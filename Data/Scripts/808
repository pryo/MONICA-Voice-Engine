Rachel:,b' (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?'
Phoebe:,b' Huh?'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Sure. Yeah, he\x92s kinda sexy.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, no, I\x92ll be there too.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay so, we\x92ll just come up with some kind of signal if it\x92s\ngoing well you can take off.'"
Rachel:,b' No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven\x92t told him\nI\x92m pregnant yet.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh. Why not?'
Rachel:,b' \x91Cause I know he\x92s gonna flip out and I hate it when he\x92s\nangry.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh Rachel, this is all so \x91Papa don\x92t preach.\x92'"
Rachel:,b' What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw\nme doing that again he\x92d make me eat the entire pack.'
Phoebe:,"b' Wow! Oh well, I will be there! '"
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Phoebe:,b' Gosh. I\x92m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both\nsit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who\nis that guy? I think I know him.'
Rachel:,b' (panicking) No you don\x92t.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!!! Monica!! He\x92s the stripper from your bachelorette\nparty!!'
Chandler:,b' Her what?!!'
Phoebe:,b' Your '
Chandler:,b' You had a bachelorette party?!'
Phoebe:,b' She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!'
Chandler:,"b' I thought we weren\x92t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!\nY\x92know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.'"
Joey:,b' It\x92s a grand tradition!'
Rachel:,b' Well you could\x92ve untied it with your hands.'
Joey:,"b' This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a\nbachelor party, but no, I wasn\x92t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!'"
Chandler:,b' You went home with the waitress.'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.'"
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t believe you didn\x92t tell me! You '
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I-I don\x92t eat meat.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I don\x92t eat that either.'"
Rachel:,b' Well actually umm\x85'
Rachel:,"b' (To Phoebe) In case you didn\x92t notice, that is a scary man.'"
Phoebe:,"b' He\x92s right though, the \x9274 is absolute piss.'"
Rachel:,"b' This was such a huge mistake. I can\x92t tell him Phoebe. I\ncan\x92t, I can\x92t, I can\x92t, I can\x92t\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Rachel!'
Rachel:,"b' No it\x92s okay, this is what\x92s gonna happen. I\x92m gonna wait\na couple years and then the baby will tell him.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Why, so he can get mad at the baby?'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, that is the\x85baby\x92s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh,\neverything okay with the waiter?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well\x85 Umm, I got '"
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s slang for pregnant.'
Rachel:,b' Phoebe!'
Rachel:,"b' Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, it\x92s Ross. It\x92s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his\nhead.) Oh daddy, I hope you\x92re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is\na good thing. You\x92re gonna\x97This is your first grandchild! You\x92re gonna be a\npoppy!'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Who?'
Rachel:,b' February 2'
Ross:,b' Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a\nlittle.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, a lot of my students do that.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I-I\x92ll see you tonight.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, bye. '"
Chandler:,b' My God! You must be good in bed!'
Joey:,"b' So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How\x92s it going?'"
Ross:,"b' Ah, it\x92s good. It\x92s going good. I mean, we get along great.\nShe\x92s, she\x92s so\x85'"
Joey:,b' Hot?'
Ross:,"b' Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!'"
Chandler:,b' She\x92s okay with Rachel and the baby?'
Ross:,"b' Well I\x85I haven\x92t actually told her yet. I don\x92t want to\nscare her off, y\x92know?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that\nyou\x92re going down the same path, but you\x92re really going down different ones.'"
Joey:,b' I\x92m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' Honey! That\x92s crazy! I don\x92t want you to get me a\nstripper\x85'
Joey:,b' Will you let the lady talk?!'
Chandler:,"b' Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it\x92s a little creepy. Y\x92know?\nI\x92m not a bachelor anymore.'"
Ross:,"b' Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his\nagreement.)'"
Chandler:,b' All right fine! But I\x92m only doing this for you!'
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' And Joey.'
Chandler:,"b' Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh actually, sorry I can\x92t even make it. I\x92m seeing Mona again\ntonight.'"
Chandler:,b' I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor\nparty?'
Joey:,b' (on cell phone) I\x92m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry I won\x92t be able to make it to your imaginary\nwedding, but I\x92m '"
Rachel:,"b' I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn\x92t want him to start\nyelling at me like I was some \x9274 Latour. '"
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s Lafite. The \x9274 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.'
Rachel:,"b' All right here he comes. I\x92m gonna do this, I\x92m gonna tell\nhim, I\x92m gonna be strong.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,b' Really?! '
Rachel:,b' There\x92s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m sorry daddy.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes. Yes, he says I\x92m damaged goods.'"
Joey:,"b' So you uh, nervous about getting married?'"
Chandler:,b' What are you doing?'
Joey:,"b' Look, look let\x92s pretend it\x92s a real bachelor party. Okay?\nY\x92know? Before your wedding. Come on, it\x92ll be fun.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. I can\x92t believe tomorrow\x92s the big day.'
Joey:,b' How does it feel knowing you\x92re never gonna be with another woman\nagain huh? Knowing you\x92re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you\nfinally have the sweet release of death.'
Chandler:,"b' You\x92re right, this is more fun.'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)'"
Chandler:,b' Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)'
Joey:,"b' Uh, that-that\x92s-that\x92s me!'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s me.'
Joey:,"b' Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, yeah right over there.'"
Chandler:,b' That was weird.'
Joey:,b' Why-why would she go in the bedroom?'
Chandler:,b' So she\x92s a\x85'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s one naked hooker!'"
Ross:,b' Uh that\x92s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.'
Ross:,b' So much more.'
Ross:,"b' Aw forget it, it\x92s from '"
Ross:,b' Y\x92know this is actually not a great time for me.'
Ross:,b' Who did?!'
Ross:,"b' Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night\nthing. It meant nothing.'"
Ross:,"b' No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care\x97I-I love\nRachel.'"
Ross:,"b' (to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean\x85I mean I\x92m not in love\nwith her. I love her like a, like a friend.'"
Ross:,b' (to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!'
Ross:,b' (To Mona) But I didn\x92t want to.'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.'"
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t believe there is a naked hooker in there!'
Joey:,b' Wait! Wait! Maybe she\x92s a hooker '
Chandler:,"b' Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed\nit. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma\x92am, are you also a stripper?'"
Joey:,"b' Maybe Monica\x92s playing a joke on ya. Y\x92know? Getting her own\nhusband a hooker, that\x92s pretty funny.'"
Chandler:,"b' That is funny, maybe for my birthday she\x92ll murder someone.'"
Joey:,b' I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh actually, I\x92d rather you\x85Yeah, go ahead. We\x92re gonna\nhave to burn that room down anyway.'"
Ross:,"b' I was going to tell you, but\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The\nphone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he\x92s trapped behind the apothecary table\nby Dr. Green.) Can I just\x85 (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don\x92t we just let the\nmachine get that?'"
Joey:,b' (on machine) Hey Ross. It\x92s Joey. There\x92s a hooker over here and\nwe thought maybe you\x92d know something about it.'
Ross:,"b' No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I\x97I need to, I need to lie down.'"
Joey:,b' Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.'
Chandler:,b' Why would she do that?'
Joey:,"b' Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything\nyou\x92re really bad at y\x92know, sexually?'"
Chandler:,b' This is the worst bachelor party ever!'
Joey:,b' In a minute!'
Chandler:,b' (To Joey) In a minute? What\x92s gonna happen in a minute?!'
Joey:,"b' All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.'"
Chandler:,b' Why me?!'
Joey:,b' Hey! It\x92s your bachelor party.'
Chandler:,b' Which is why '
Joey:,b' I don\x92t want to. You do it!'
Chandler:,b' You do it!'
Joey:,b' You do it!'
Chandler:,"b' All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!\n(Joey smirks.) What?'"
Joey:,b' I miss this.'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t think we\x92ve actually done this before!'
Joey:,"b' No, I-I miss hanging out with you.'"
Chandler:,b' Well we\x85we still hang out.'
Joey:,b' Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable.\nY\x92know now it\x92s like\x85things are different.'
Chandler:,"b' Well y\x92know, things are different. I\x92m\x85I\x92m married\nnow.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh sure\x97And hey, don\x92t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.\nI just\x85I miss\x85hanging out\x85just-just us, y\x92know?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we\x92ll make\ntime to hang out with each other.'"
Joey:,b' You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)'
Ross:,b' So your dad dropped by. He\x92s a pleasant man!'
Rachel:,b' (quietly) Oh no\x85'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92d better go. (She goes and sits down in the '
Rachel:,"b' Ross I\x92m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this\nout with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.'"
Ross:,b' I don\x92t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now\nshe\x92s totally freaked out!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh okay, I\x92ll fix that to. What\x92s her e-mail address?'"
Ross:,b' Rachel!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, I promise. I\x92ll fix this. I swear.\nI\x92ll-I\x92ll-I\x92ll-I\x92ll talk to her.'"
Ross:,b' Okay!'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Thank you!'
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a\nbreak!"" ""No we weren\x92t!"" What happened to you two?!'"
Ross:,b' Thank you so much for coming back over.'
Rachel:,"b' I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I\x92m so sorry about my\nfather yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You\x92re gonna have to\ntell me how you did that.'"
Ross:,b' Focus.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Um\x85But\x97Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are\ngonna have a baby. But we are '"
Rachel:,b' Oh we just\x97we drove each other crazy!'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the\nlittle things go!'"
Ross:,b' Trying to date this woman.'
Rachel:,"b' Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and\nthoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)'"
Ross:,b' Probably shouldn\x92t touch me.'
Rachel:,"b' I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean\nwe all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at\nher.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)'"
Ross:,b' Should I leave this open for you too?'
Ross:,b' Because what\x92s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel\nabout you.'
Ross:,"b' I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it\nfrom Rachel\x92s father. Look I\x85I made a mistake, but it\x92s only because I\nreally, really like you. Really!'"
Rachel:,"b' (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up.\n(To Mona) He\x92s a good kisser isn\x92t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.)\nI\x92m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Her ass print is still on your grandmother\x92s quilt, do you really\nwant to talk about smoking?'"
Chandler:,b' Monica! Wait!'
Chandler:,b' (puts on his crown) Carry on.'
Chandler:,b' Could you not narrate?'
Phoebe:,"b' (entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.'"
Rachel:,b' About an hour ago.'
Phoebe:,b' Wanna go see a movie?'
Rachel:,b' Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it\nup.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)'
Joey:,b' (on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!\n(Listens) What gives you the right to\x85 (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and\nopens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.'
