Phoebe:,"b' Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,\noh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?'"
Chandler:,"b"" You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)\nsomething funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)"""
Joey:,"b' (joins him) I gotta get one, too.'"
Ross:,b' (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?'
Chandler:,"b"" We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?"""
Ross:,"b' Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in\nthe world.'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."""
Ross:,"b"" This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better\nget used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask\nquestions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."""
Chandler:,b' Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about\nbreast-feeding?'
Joey:,"b' Uh, does it hurt?'"
Joey:,b' Chandler?'
Chandler:,"b' So, uh, how often can you do it?'"
Joey:,"b' Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get\nbigger?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I forget which ones.'"
Rachel:,b' (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.'
Phoebe:,"b"" I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."""
Ross:,"b' (enters) Hi, honey.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, sweetums.'"
Ross:,b' Hello to the rest.'
Joey:,"b"" Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about\nRachel?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Come on, you're going to """
Phoebe:,"b' Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.'"
Ross:,"b' (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?'"
Ross:,"b"" It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."""
Phoebe:,"b' Woof, woof. '"
Joey:,b' (A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men?\n(Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.) '
Joey:,b' Who?'
Joey:,"b"" What's he doin' in my section?"""
Joey:,"b"" Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man)\nHey, how ya doin'?"""
Joey:,"b"" Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from\nYoung Men's to the escalator is my territory."""
Joey:,b' Yeah. Bijan for men?'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, all right. What did I have?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."""
Rachel:,"b"" (entering) Hey, guys, what's up."""
Phoebe:,"b' I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.'"
Rachel:,b' You went shopping for fur?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought\nsome, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs."""
Rachel:,b' You bought boobs?'
Phoebe:,b' (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought\nbras. '
Joey:,"b"" (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan\nfor... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh,\nlisten, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."""
Joey:,"b"" (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy\nspraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and\nJoey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?! """
Ross:,"b"" Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,\nwe play. It's like we're father and son."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, this is so cute.'"
Ross:,"b"" My mommies love me. That's clever."""
Rachel:,"b' Did you just say Hi, Jew?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ben, dinner!'"
Ross:,"b"" Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's\nbreast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."""
Phoebe:,"b' Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her\nwrist and tastes it.)'"
Chandler:,b' What did you just do?'
Phoebe:,"b' I licked my arm, what?'"
Ross:,"b"" It's breast milk."""
Phoebe:,b' So?'
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.'"
Joey:,b' What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)'
Chandler:,b' What did you just do?'
Ross:,"b' Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" You won't even taste it?"""
Ross:,b' No!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?"""
Ross:,"b"" Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it."""
Rachel:,"b"" They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the\npocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and\nnotices she also grabbed a receipt.)'"
Rachel:,b' And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?'
Rachel:,"b"" Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"""
Rachel:,b' Who?'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,b' You were with Julie?'
Rachel:,b' Oh. Oh my God. '
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, right.\xa0 Sure!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?'"
Rachel:,"b' Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."""
Ross:,b' I did not freak out. '
Ross:,"b"" Because it's breast milk. It's gross."""
Ross:,"b"" No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think\nbreast milk is for adults."""
Chandler:,b' Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.'
Ross:,b' (jumping away) That would be no.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Come on. It doesn't taste bad."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."""
Joey:,b' Exactly.'
Ross:,"b"" (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, you've tasted it."""
Ross:,b' (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and\nRoss squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it\noff.) '
Chandler:,b' Howdy.'
Joey:,"b' (sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a\njuice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."""
Joey:,"b"" Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people\non it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes\nthrough two bottles a day."""
Chandler:,"b"" (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you\ncare? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you."""
Joey:,"b"" I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs\nthe glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.\nThey need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."""
Chandler:,"b"" (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.\nYou know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And\nthen where're you gonna run?"""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah I guess you're right."""
Chandler:,"b"" You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made\nof. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west\nof the lingerie."""
Joey:,"b"" I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)"""
Chandler:,"b"" All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice\nhooker."""
Rachel:,"b"" Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"""
Rachel:,b' Yes.'
Rachel:,"b"" Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy\nwho might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually\n(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you."""
Rachel:,b' I love you too. (They hug.)'
Phoebe:,"b"" You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with\nme, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and\nsits down.)"""
Rachel:,"b"" (crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that."""
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)'"
Joey:,"b"" Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, I'm ready."""
Joey:,"b"" These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.\nListen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"""
Rachel:,"b"" So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you\nknow, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,\nthough, right?"""
Rachel:,b' Really? Me?'
Rachel:,"b"" Well, you're not totally paranoid."""
Rachel:,"b"" Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it\nwas really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but\num, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,\nMonica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."""
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."""
Rachel:,"b' All right, Julie.'"
