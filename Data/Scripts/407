Chandler:,b' (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy\nnaked! It was like torture!'
Ross:,"b"" Y'know if we ever go to war and you\x92re captured, you\x92re in for a\n"""
Chandler:,"b"" It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it\x92s bad\nenough that I\x92m in love with my roommates girlfriend\x97which by the way, I think\nshe knows. Because every time we\x92re in the room together there\x92s this weird like\nenergy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen\nher naked. I mean at least when I\x92ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her\nbody was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she\x92s smooth!\nSmooth! (leaves)"""
Phoebe:,b' Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?'
Joey:,"b' Great! All right, so I\x92ll call you later.'"
Chandler:,b' (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?'
Joey:,b' That would be Casey. We\x92re going out tonight.'
Chandler:,"b' Goin\x92 out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So\nthings didn\x92t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.'"
Joey:,"b' No, things are fine with Kathy. I\x92m having a late dinner with her\ntonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.'"
Chandler:,b' (shocked) What?'
Joey:,b' Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by\nmyself! (Laughs)'
Chandler:,b' Wait! You\x92re going out with Kathy!'
Joey:,b' Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I\x92m upset\x97for you. I mean, having sex with an endless\nline of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can\x92t believe he just\nsad that.)'"
Joey:,b' What is the big deal? It\x92s not like we\x92re exclusive.'
Chandler:,"b' Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But\nCasey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that\nshe\x92s-she\x92s smart, and funny, and gets you.'"
Joey:,b' You got all that from the back of her head?'
Chandler:,"b"" All right look, I think it\x92s time for you to settle down. Y'know?\nMake a choice, pick a lane."""
Joey:,b' Who\x92s Elaine?'
Phoebe:,"b' (singing) ""'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, you could just go uh, ""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about\n\x91bah-bah-bha-bhan?\x92'"
Ross:,"b' Well umm, y\x92know, I used to play.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, that\x92s right, the keyboards, huh?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in\ncollege. I mean that\x92s-that\x92s when I really found my sound.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' I wanna hear ""The Sound.""'"
Ross:,"b' Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven\x92t played in so long, and-and, well\nit\x92s-it\x92s really personal stuff, y\x92know?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Come on, play that funky music white boy.'"
Ross:,"b' No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in\x97No, yeah,\nokay. (Runs out.)'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, guys.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right! Bring it on, you\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Here we go. (Plays one note) Y\x92know, I\x92ve-I\x92ve never played\nmy stuff for anyone before, so it\x92s important that-that you understand it\x92s\nabout communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y\x92know, umm, you\nshould-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That\x92s what\nI\x92m\x85'"
Chandler:,b' (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!'
Chandler:,"b' Really, bitchin\x92!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, it was so\x97wow!'"
Ross:,"b' Really?! I mean, really?!!'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!'"
Ross:,"b' Wow! Thanks, you guys. That\x92s uh\x97ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you\nanother piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I\x92ll be\nright back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I\x92m\x97I am so\x85\n(starts to break up and leaves)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I can\x92t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.'"
Phoebe:,"b' What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus\nit\x92s just, it\x92s so different from the stuff you usually hear.'"
Chandler:,"b' You mean like, music?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I know what you\x92re thinkin\x92! Yes, yes, your breasts\nare just as firm and juicy.'"
Chandler:,b' Come in!'
Chandler:,"b' Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.'"
Chandler:,"b' No-no, he\x92s not back yet, but he\x92ll be here any minute. So\nuh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?'"
Chandler:,"b' I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) \x85of the\nboat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.'"
Joey:,"b' (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it\x92s me. Listen Casey and I\nwere on our way back and had a little car trouble.'"
Chandler:,b' What happened?'
Joey:,"b' We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some\ntransmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I\x92ll be there as\nsoon as I can.'"
Chandler:,b' Why can\x92t you tell her?'
Joey:,"b' \x91Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about\nto\x97(he stops talking suddenly)'"
Chandler:,b' Joey! Joey!!'
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Chandler:,b' I thought your time ran out.'
Joey:,"b' Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more\x97(his time runs out for\nreal)'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He\x92s running a little late, he\nsays he\x92s sorry.'"
Chandler:,"b' So I guess it\x92s just uh, you and me then.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I think it is!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut\x85'"
Chandler:,b' \x85and then it got canceled.'
Chandler:,b' Really?! You do that?'
Chandler:,"b' Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don\x92t make my tail too poofy.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through\nhis hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y\x92know who also has\ngreat hair is Joey!'"
Chandler:,b' What-what \x91cha doin\x92?'
Chandler:,b' \x91Kay.'
Chandler:,b' (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone\x92s making\nsounds! (On phone) Hello!'
Joey:,"b' (on phone) Hey dude, it\x92s me.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey it\x92s Joey!'
Joey:,"b' Listen uh, I\x92m really sorry, it looks like I\x92m gonna be stuck\nhere for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the\ntransmission wasn\x92t there!'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it must\x92ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit\na dog.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)'
Chandler:,b' Yeah. Yes! Yeah. '
Chandler:,b' Oh. '
Chandler:,"b' No-no-no-no, this is bad! It\x92s bad! This is bad!'"
Chandler:,"b' Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?'"
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Chandler:,"b' Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here\x92s what we do, we-we forget it happened.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we\x92re unhappy\nforever. Sound good?'"
Chandler:,"b' I have to; he\x92s my best friend, and you\x92re seeing him.'"
Chandler:,"b' (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don\x92t! Don\x92t! See-see,\nyou\x92re getting me confused, I\x92m starting to urn. '"
Chandler:,b' I-I think we have too.'
Chandler:,b' Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against\nthe door.) Are you still out there?'
Ross:,b' (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays\nthe sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time\x85'
Phoebe:,b' (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It\x92s so inspired! Look at him!\nLook at him go!'
Ross:,b' (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no, I\x92m not playing tonight.'"
Rachel:,b' Why not?'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t follow Ross! It\x92d be like those bicycle ridding chimps\nthat followed '
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God, he\x92s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give\nanything to not be appreciated in my own time!'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, Phoebe you\x92re\x85 awful!'"
Phoebe:,b' You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)'
Joey:,b' Aww man! I can\x92t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the\ndoor.)'
Chandler:,b' Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to\nreveal a fully furnished apartment.)'
Joey:,b' (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?'
Chandler:,b' I sure did.'
Joey:,b' Why?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I just thought it\x92d make me feel good to do something nice\nfor my friend.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, you\x92re amazing.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh no-no-no. '
Joey:,"b' (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That\x92s the dream!\nMan, how did you afford this stuff?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, y\x92know I\x92m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t know.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey\nlisten, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I\x92m\ngonna do that.'"
Chandler:,b' You mean with Casey.'
Joey:,"b' No-no-no, I think I\x92m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She\x92s\npretty cool.'"
Chandler:,b' Or Casey.'
Joey:,"b' No-no, Kathy.'"
Chandler:,b' Could be Casey.'
Joey:,"b' No. No, Kathy.'"
Chandler:,b' Consider Casey.'
Joey:,b' Y\x92know what I think? I think somebody\x92s got a little crush on\nCasey. How \x91bout I fix you two up? What do you think?'
Chandler:,b' That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!'
Ross:,b' (to Phoebe) Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don\x92t want to\nplay anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.'"
Ross:,b' Pheebs\x85'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, I-I can\x92t\x97I mean y\x92know I was trying to be really\ny'know okay and upbeat about it, I just\x97I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.\nI\x85"""
Ross:,"b' See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.\nY\x92know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I\x85\nI won\x92t play anymore.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no. No-no-no, don\x92t do that! How could I live with myself if I\nknew I was depriving the world of your music.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, okay.'"
Ross:,b' Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.'
Chandler:,b' I kissed Kathy.'
Ross:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' Does Joey know?'
Chandler:,"b' No. Is there anyway, '"
Ross:,"b' No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you\nkissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would\x92ve just stepped aside.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, don\x92t say that! Don\x92t say that. That\x92s not true. Is\nit?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I think maybe, yeah.'"
Chandler:,b' Then why didn\x92t you tell me to do that?!!'
Ross:,"b' Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! No, that\x92s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.'"
Rachel:,"b' I know, I remember that!'"
Chandler:,b' God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, Chandler, you\x92re gonna have to tell him.'"
Chandler:,b' Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!'
Rachel:,b' Because you do.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I know.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey! Samboucha Margarita? '
Chandler:,b' Is that a real thing?'
Joey:,"b' Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.'"
Chandler:,"b' Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.'"
Joey:,b' What\x92s up?'
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s-it\x92s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot\nactually.'"
Joey:,b' You do?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Well, you\x92re timing couldn\x92t be better. She\x92s not my\ngirlfriend anymore.'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, she broke up with me.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh uh, when?'"
Joey:,"b' Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind\nof scene, that\x92s why I let people watch.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I\x92ve been better. But, I\x92m all right. So you like her huh?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, but I-I uh, don\x92t have too.'"
Joey:,"b' No-no-no, no it\x92s uh, it\x92s okay.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,b' Yeah. You know why? \x91Cause you came to me first.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.'"
Joey:,"b' But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you\x92re work cut out\nfor you. \x91Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she\x92s into\nsome other guy. So\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' See uh, that\x92s-that\x92s actually what I wanted to talk to you\nabout. I-I think I know who the other guy is.'"
Joey:,b' Who?'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s me. I\x92m the other guy.'
Joey:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to\ntalking, and one thing to another and\x85'"
Joey:,b' And what?! Did you sleep with her?!'
Chandler:,b' No! No! No! I just kissed her.'
Joey:,b' What?!! That\x92s even worse!!'
Chandler:,b' How is that worse?!'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know! But it\x92s the same!'
Chandler:,"b' Look, I\x92m sorry! But there\x92s nothing I can do, I think\nI\x92m in love with her!'"
Joey:,b' Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!'
Chandler:,"b' You\x92re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.'"
Joey:,"b' Over the line?! You-you\x92re-you\x92re so far past the line, that\nyou-you can\x92t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!'"
Chandler:,b' Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!'
Joey:,"b' Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like\n""Well, kinda."") Well, y\x92know what I will not watch your TV, I will not\nlisten to your stereo, and there\x92s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that\nI\x92m not gonna eat! You know why?!'"
Chandler:,b' Probably because\x85'
Joey:,"b' Because it\x92s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this\napartment is empty for me! And I\x92m not happy about you either. (The bread maker\ndings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom\nand slams the door.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God, he\x92s lost it. He\x92s totally lost it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, his music could not '"
Ross:,"b' Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.\nY\x92know, I\x92m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my\nset?'"
Phoebe:,"b' After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, like I could '"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' I played bad on purpose guys.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah\x97no, just that last song.'"
