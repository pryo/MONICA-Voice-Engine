Rachel:,"b"" Oh God... well, it started about a half hour\nbefore the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was\nlooking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-\n(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned\non by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it\nhit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked\nfamiliar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I\ndoing this, and who am I doing this for?'.
