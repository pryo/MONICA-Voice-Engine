Phoebe:,"b' Hey! New wallet, huh?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just\ndoesn\x92t say \x91cool\x92 anymore.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I thought you '"
Rachel:,b' Right!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.'"
Rachel:,b' Ummm. Oh! I\x92m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)\nIt\x92s a little old but\x85'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m sorry. I didn\x92t\x97I don\x92t come in here a lot.'
Rachel:,b' No.'
Rachel:,b' I didn\x92t\x85 I never said that.'
Rachel:,"b' (starting to cry) Okay, I\x92m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the\npizza box.)'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?'"
Rachel:,b' Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. '
Joey:,b' I\x92m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.'
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s easy for you to say, you weren\x92t almost just killed.'"
Joey:,"b' All right that\x92s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the\ndoor.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I\x92ve\nmissed the last 1200 times.'"
Ross:,b' So why don\x92t you quit?'
Chandler:,b' You don\x92t think I\x92ve tried? You think I '
Ross:,b' Who is Maria?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh Maria. You can\x92t say no to her, she\x92s like this lycra\nspandex covered gym\x85treat.'"
Ross:,b' You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?'
Chandler:,b' No!'
Ross:,b' So you\x92re strong enough to face her on your own?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh no, you\x92ll have to come.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,\nyou\x92re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the\nlandlord.'"
Joey:,"b' Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.'"
Joey:,b' I have actually '
Joey:,"b' Why don\x92t you tell me something I don\x92t know! (He storms out,\nand once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an \x91Oops!\x92 have.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh please, somebody tell me I don\x92t have to go to work today!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every\ntime I see him I just want to do things to him that I\x92m not allowed to charge for.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling\naround with clients. And it\x92s against my oath as a masseuse.'"
Ross:,b' They make you take an oath?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and\numm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one\x92s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just\nmakes good sense.'"
Chandler:,b' Why don\x92t you just give him to somebody else?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, I can handle it. No, I\x92m a professional. (She starts to leave)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?'"
Chandler:,b' Because that\x92s the only part of you he can see when he\x92s on\nthe table!'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to\nleaqve)'
Ross:,b' Then how do you explain the toe ring?!'
Phoebe:,b' Because it\x92s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!'
Rachel:,b' Oh! My hero! What happened?'
Joey:,"b' Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like\nthat and that he\x92d better come up here and apologize. I\x92ll see you later.\n(Starts to leave)'"
Joey:,"b' He said that he wasn\x92t gonna apologize because you guys are living\nhere illegally, so instead what he\x92s gonna do is have you evicted\x97I\x92ll see\nyou later.'"
Rachel:,b' What?! You got us evicted!!'
Joey:,b' Well he made Rachel cry!'
Rachel:,b' That\x92s not true! (Starts to cry.)'
Joey:,"b' All right! I\x92ll try! But if I can\x92t, you can stay with Chandler\nand I until you get settled.'"
Rachel:,b' Go!!'
Joey:,"b' All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns\naround) I mean I\x92ll have to check with him first, but I\x92ll think he\x92ll be\ncool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)'"
Ross:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be\nstrong.'"
Chandler:,b' Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!'
Ross:,"b' One more time, ""Hey, don\x92t you want a washboard stomach and rock\nhard pecs?""'"
Chandler:,b' No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!'
Ross:,b' Good! That\x92s good!'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.'
Chandler:,b' I wanna quit the gym.'
Chandler:,b' (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a \x91Be strong\x92 sound.) I\nwanna quit the gym.'
Ross:,b' Me? No.'
Chandler:,b' (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about\nhimself) I wanna quit the gym.'
Ross:,"b' It\x92s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)'"
Ross:,"b' No! And I\x92m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.'"
Phoebe:,b' These old things.'
Phoebe:,"b' You mean the\x97Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in\nthe siadic area can get y\x92know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm,\ntell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)'"
Phoebe:,b' No!'
Joey:,"b' Please don\x92t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn\x92t there\nfault, it was mine.'"
Joey:,"b' No you can\x92t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?'"
Joey:,"b' Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I\x92m the chick and Chandler is the\nduck.'"
Joey:,"b' Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I\x92ll do whatever you want.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah-yeah, absolutely.'"
Joey:,"b' What, what is it?'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s not, prison lingo, is it?'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, there\x92s this superintendent\x92s dance, the Super Ball. I\ndon\x92t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he\x92s a crush on.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, why doesn\x92t he practice with a girl?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, he\x92s too shy, he doesn\x92t thing he\x92s good enough to\ndance with girls yet.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that\x85garbage chute.\n(Starts to cry)'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey! So, did you quit?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I almost did, couldn\x92t leave Ross there without a spotter!'"
Ross:,"b' And that\x92s funny, why?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, umm, I was just y\x92know working out and umm\x85 Oh,\nthat\x92s it.'"
Chandler:,"b' We\x92re doomed. Okay, they\x92re gonna take 50 bucks out of our\naccounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?'"
Ross:,"b' Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at\nthe source.'"
Chandler:,b' You\x92re a genius!'
Joey:,"b' Aww, man, now we won\x92t be bank buddies!'"
Chandler:,"b' Now, there\x92s two reasons.'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.'"
Rachel:,b' Where?!'
Phoebe:,b' On the touchy.'
Ross:,b' And '
Phoebe:,"b' No, I know! I-I\x92m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna\nthrow out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I\x92m doing something exciting and I\ndon\x92t wanna get '
Chandler:,"b' Thank you, Joey.'"
Joey:,"b' No-no, thank you.'"
Joey:,"b' All right, I\x92m here, let\x92s ahh, get this over with.'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa, don\x92t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like\nahh, get really drunk?'"
Joey:,"b' No, it\x92s okay, but if I\x92m Marge, my breasts are coming out my\nback.'"
Joey:,"b' Come on man, you\x92re not a potato.'"
Joey:,"b' Come on Treeger, don\x92t say that. You just ahh, you just need more\npractice. Here, come on, let\x92s ahh, let\x92s try it again. Come on. (they start\ndancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y\x92know,\nI\x92m not really that comfortable dancing with a\x97(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!'"
Joey:,"b' Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a\nlittle dance step on the way.)'"

Chandler:,b' To pay for the gym.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started\nmaking out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.'"

Rachel:,b' Sweety...'
Phoebe:,"b' I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next,\ny\x92know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these\npolicemen, thought I was a whore too. It\x92s been a really bad day, whore wise.'"
