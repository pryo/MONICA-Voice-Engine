Joey:,"b' Ross, did you really read all these baby books?'"
Ross:,"b"" Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no\ncompass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually\neat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)'"

Phoebe:,"b' (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)'"
Joey:,"b"" Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?\n(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like\nvoice) Hi Daddy! """
Ross:,b' (waves) Hello!'
Rachel:,"b"" Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching\nPaolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)"""
Rachel:,"b"" Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."""
Phoebe:,"b' Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!'"
Rachel:,b' I know...'
Chandler:,"b"" (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"""
Ross:,"b"" Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes\nflinging motions with hands) flung by now?"""
Rachel:,"b"" I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things\nthat I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,\nI'm totally, totally..."""
Ross:,"b"" ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call\nimmigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!"""

Ross:,"b' Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!'"
Ross:,"b"" No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you\nknow, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!\n(pauses) Or isn't..."""
Ross:,b' Susan...'
Ross:,"b"" Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"""
Ross:,"b' Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? '"
Ross:,"b"" No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,\nthen punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)"""
Chandler:,"b"" Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"""
Joey:,"b"" That's the rule."""
Chandler:,"b"" What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"""
Joey:,"b"" How'd you get to that?"""
Chandler:,"b' Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little\nbreakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio'"
Joey:,b' You knew about that?'
Chandler:,"b"" Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left\nlittle to the imagination."""
Joey:,"b' Ok, ok, How about if we split it?'"
Chandler:,"b' What do you mean, like, buy it together?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah'
Chandler:,"b"" You think we're ready for something like that?"""
Joey:,b' Why not?'
Chandler:,"b"" Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to\nmove out?"""
Joey:,"b' Why, are you moving out?'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm not moving out. """
Joey:,"b"" You'd tell me if you were moving out right"""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."""
Joey:,"b' Aw, I know all about Kip!'"
Chandler:,"b"" It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and\ngot married, and things got pretty ugly."""
Joey:,"b' Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Aw, don't do that"""
Phoebe:,"b' Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,\nto take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"""
Ross:,"b"" Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"""
Joey:,"b"" So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and\nwaves arms frantically in protest)"""
Ross:,"b"" Wait\x97oh\x97hey\x97huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"""
Joey:,b' Or an uncle... '

Joey:,"b' Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!'"
Chandler:,"b' More coffee over here, please!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.)\nAnd all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolo\nrolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.'"
Rachel:,"b' ""Ooo,"" what?'"
Phoebe:,b' Uma Thurman.'
Ross:,b' The actress!'
Ross:,b' Thanks Rach.'
Chandler:,b' So what are you gonna do?'
Ross:,"b"" You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as\na friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to\nchime in)"""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.'"
Joey:,"b"" Feminist issue. That's where I went!"""
Phoebe:,b' She is gonna hate me.'
Joey:,"b' Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a\ntable)'"

Joey:,"b' I don\'t know, birds just don\'t say, ""Hello, sit here, eat\nsomething.""'"
Chandler:,b' You pick one.'
Joey:,"b' All right, how about the ladybugs?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine\ndining!'"
Joey:,"b' Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey\nturns and gives Chandler a dirty look)"""
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi Pheebs!'

Rachel:,"b' Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a\ntime, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are\nthe most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal\nraisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other\ncookies"""
Rachel:,"b"" All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've\never had."""
Phoebe:,b' Which proves that I never lie.'
Rachel:,"b"" I guess you don't."""
Phoebe:,b' Paolo made a pass at me.'
Chandler:,"b' So, what do you think?'"
Ross:,"b"" I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen."""

Joey:,"b"" Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"""
Phoebe:,b' Are you okay?'
Rachel:,b' I need some milk.'

Rachel:,"b' Ok, Ok, Pheebs...'"
Phoebe:,b' The end.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, God...'"
Phoebe:,b' Should I not have told you?'
Rachel:,"b"" No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just\nliked it better before it was better..."""
Phoebe:,"b"" I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,\nso..."""
Joey:,"b' No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there\nteam.'"
Ross:,"b' Come on, two on one.'"
Chandler:,"b"" What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's\ntime for you to swoop in!"""
Ross:,"b' What, now?'"
Joey:,"b"" Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out\nof there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's\nnot! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"""
Chandler:,"b"" My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.\nYou pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off\ninto the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)"""
Ross:,"b"" (entering) How's it going?"""

Ross:,b' You all right?'
Rachel:,"b"" Ooh, I've been better..."""
Ross:,"b' Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than\nhim...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he\nhas you.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Ross...'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b"" I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want\nto think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)"""
Ross:,b' Huh.'

Rachel:,b' Oh...'
Phoebe:,b' You ok?'
Rachel:,b' ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?'
Phoebe:,b' Yep!'
Ross:,"b"" See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the\nanswer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated\nscreening process."""
Rachel:,"b' No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to\nfigure out what I want'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.'"
Rachel:,"b"" No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up\nto be one."""
Rachel:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b"" I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."""
Ross:,"b"" Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?"""
Ross:,"b"" I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"""
Chandler:,b' Wha-'

Ross:,"b"" I'm having a son. Um..."""
Joey:,"b"" Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, get out!'"
Chandler:,b' (to Joey) One more game?'
Joey:,b' Oh yeah!'
