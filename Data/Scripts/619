Joey:,"b' Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a\nscrewdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and\nshocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge! '"
Rachel:,"b' Hi Joey, how ya doin\x92?'"
Joey:,b' Great! Roomie!'
Rachel:,"b' Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to\nget a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m not paying for half of that! I\x92m only staying here until\nmy apartment gets fixed.'
Joey:,"b' Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now,\nI have '"
Rachel:,b' That refrigerators don\x92t live as long as people.'
Joey:,"b' All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a\ntime, I\x92ll take a check for the other hundred.'"
Rachel:,b' You\x92re jokin\x92 right?'
Joey:,b' Of course I\x92m jokin\x92! I don\x92t take checks.'
Rachel:,b' Thank God you\x92re pretty. (Exits.)'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Do you guys know any cute guys?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey\x92s\narm, Joey pats Chandler\x92s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same\nabout him.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. Thank you Chandler.'"
Rachel:,"b' Anyway, there\x92s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren\nbought a table, so I kinda have to go\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, something either trees or disease\x97Ralph mumbles\na lot.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah! It\x92s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to '"
Chandler:,b' So he has to be a male who has at least $50.'
Joey:,b' Ooh! So close.'
Ross:,b' Hey everybody!'
Ross:,"b' Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.'"
Chandler:,b' (laughs) Isn\x92t she cute? (On Monica\x92s death stare) No!'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, this is probably none of my business, but weren\x92t you\nguys supposed to not be seen in public together?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no-no-no, we\x92re just two people who happen to run into each other\nhere at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, sly.'"
Ross:,b' Bye.'
Ross:,b' Oh that is quite all right ma\x92am. (Elizabeth exits.)'
Chandler:,"b' So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of\nhomework to do?'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, tell her good luck with that.'"
Ross:,b' Anyone else? Huh? Bring \x91em on!'
Rachel:,b' Oo! When\x92s her birthday?!'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know Rachel, why?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know it\x92s just been so long since I\x92ve been to '"
Ross:,b' Well thanks!'
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how\x92s it\ngoing with her?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, actually it\x92s been great. She\x92s 20 so she\x92s not\nlooking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.'"
Ross:,"b' Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really\nmeans a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah. Do we have any '
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh that\x92s so funny because we found someone too.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh that\x92s good, I guess she\x92ll have a choice between my guy\nand your weirdo.'"
Chandler:,b' Why would our guy be a weirdo?'
Phoebe:,b' \x91Cause that\x92s just your taste.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b' My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She\nsqueezes the skin on her chin together to form\x85)'"
Chandler:,b' A face ass?'
Phoebe:,b' A chin dimple!'
Phoebe:,b' Have you seen your guy\x92s body?'
Chandler:,"b' No, our guy is just a floating head.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He\x92s a massage client and one\ntime umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, like there are police for that!'"
Chandler:,b' (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.'
Phoebe:,b' I know. (Laughs.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, Chandler funny?'"
Phoebe:,b' My guy is well read.'
Chandler:,b' Our guy has great hair.'
Phoebe:,b' My guy has great teeth!'
Chandler:,b' Our guy smells incredible.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Huh.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, you\x85don\x92t look good Joe.'"
Joey:,"b' The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,\nlimes\x97Hey, what was in that brown jar?'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s still in there?!'
Joey:,"b' Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?'"
Chandler:,b' Is this a service you\x92re providing me?'
Joey:,b' No! No! No! For my new fridge\x97our new fridge!'
Chandler:,b' '
Joey:,"b' So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.'"
Chandler:,b' Uh-huh.'
Joey:,"b' And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I\ngotta buy a new kid.'"
Chandler:,b' (not quite sure where Joey\x92s going and is a little worried)\nOkay\x85'
Joey:,b' (pause) Give me $400!'
Ross:,"b' Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don\x92t\nknow.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?'"
Ross:,"b' Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don\x92t we go\ninside?'"
Ross:,b' Oh-ooh!'
Ross:,b' Doorknob! Doorknob!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, okay. What-what about?'"
Ross:,b' Spring vacation.'
Ross:,"b' (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor\nFeesen-sen-stenlger\x85 I\x92ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will\ntake one box of the '"
Ross:,"b' You don\x92t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip\nwith her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I\x92m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I\ntell her?'"
Chandler:,b' Just tell her the truth! Tell her you\x92re not ready.'
Ross:,"b' I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?'"
Chandler:,b' Then you distract her with a '
Joey:,"b' Or! You can just, y\x92know\x85 (He walks up close to whisper in\nRoss\x92s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)'"
Ross:,b' What the hell are you doing?'
Joey:,b' What? What the hell am '
Ross:,"b' What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!'"
Joey:,"b' Oh-ho-ho, you think I don\x92t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!\n(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That\x92ll be $400!'"
Chandler:,"b' Joey, I '"
Joey:,b' (pause) You pushed him!'
Ross:,"b' Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside\nand recoils in disgust.) '"
Joey:,"b' All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?'"
Chandler:,b' Uh-huh.'
Joey:,b' I still haven\x92t gotten a check for your half yet.'
Ross:,b' Do '
Joey:,b' I\x92m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!'
Ross:,"b' Yes. Yes! Please, come in.'"
Ross:,b' Oo-oo!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to\nfinish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, I\x85 (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I\x92m having\na great time with you and I just don\x92t want us to move to fast or put to much\npressure on us. So, I\x92m sorry I just don\x92t think we should go away together yet.\nIt\x92s-it\x92s too soon.'"
Ross:,b' No. I think you misunderstood what '
Ross:,b' That! Let\x92s talk about that.'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She\ndidn\x92t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she\x92s going\nto Florida for spring vacation.'"
Chandler:,"b' Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for\nspring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)'"
Ross:,b' What\x92s-what\x92s the difference?'
Ross:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.'"
Phoebe:,b' What did you do on yours?'
Ross:,b' I went to Egypt with my dad.'
Chandler:,"b' I can see it now, ""Look dad, it\x92s the Sphinx!"" (Does\nthat party noise again.)'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, ""Spring\nbreak!"" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she\x92s taken my class!'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m gonna call her.'
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.'"
Rachel:,"b' We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last '"
Rachel:,b' Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel, what the hell is this?!'"
Rachel:,b' (shocked) What?'
Phoebe:,b' You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your\nown!'
Rachel:,b' You found me a guy?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I\nthink I\x92m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.'"
Chandler:,b' Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, thank you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No reason, it\x92s just I know a single guy that cares about other\npeople.'"
Chandler:,b' Are you funny?'
Rachel:,b' What are you guys doing?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, so do a lot of people.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, but y\x92know, no, you didn\x92t give me your phone number.'"
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny. '
Rachel:,b' I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of\nyou!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat\x92s name?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, y\x92know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the\nkind of guy you\x92d like to take to a ball? ""Hey Sebastian, would you like to\ndance?"" (Imitates him.) ""Uhh, okay\x97I gotta go!""'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y\x92know you might even end up with\nsomeone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.'
Rachel:,b' All right.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, so you will meet our guys?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes, I\x92ll meet \x91em.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay now it doesn\x92t matter which one you choose, y\x92know?\nIt\x92s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe\ndeemed not good enough to go out with herself.'"
Joey:,"b' (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me\n400 bucks!'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay sure!'
Joey:,b' Really?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your\nlast ten auditions.'"
Joey:,b' Call it even?'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b' (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.\nThat means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl\x92s bodies,\nwaking up next to people you don\x92t even know\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Man, she is going to have a '"
Chandler:,b' You know the hotels?'
Joey:,b' Sure! I was there! Spring Break \x9281! Woo-hoo!'
Joey:,"b' So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y\x92know who\nknows how to party? Drunk college chicks.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, she can\x92t go.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ross, you can\x92t tell her not to go. You just started dating.'"
Ross:,b' Then what am I supposed to do?'
Phoebe:,"b' Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, maybe you '"
Ross:,b' I\x92m so glad you\x92re going on this trip!'
Ross:,"b' Sure. Sure. Look I don\x92t, I don\x92t know if your plans are\nfinalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.'"
Ross:,b' Are you into crafts at all?'
Ross:,"b' Well, yeah, of-of course I\x92m okay! What? I\x92m just being\nsupportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what\nis uh, what\x92s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)'"
Ross:,b' To wear in front of people?'
Ross:,b' Is this?!'
Chandler:,b' Good-good-good-good.'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' Oh\x85'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know. I know I don\x92t work late tomorrow night.'
Chandler:,"b' Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y\x92know\nwhat? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come\nhere! (He stands up from the next table.)'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Well-well a little blind sided but y\x92know good.'
Chandler:,"b' Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!'"
Rachel:,b' I\x97Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)'
Chandler:,b' There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)'
Phoebe:,b' This is Patrick. (Points to him.)'
Chandler:,"b' Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you\x92re too late okay? Because she\x92s\nalready with our guy.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (looks) Oh my God, you\x92re right! I am too late; they\x92re\nsitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)\nRachel?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,b' This is Patrick.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, hi.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about. '"
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what\x92s\nunderneath it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh-okay, but Pheebs?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m just sort of in the middle of something.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! Okay! Yeah, that\x92s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits\nPatrick down next to Rachel.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, y\x92know what? Maybe I should go!'"
Chandler:,b' It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m good.'"
Phoebe:,b' Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.'
Chandler:,b' (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To\nEldad) You dance for Rachel!'
Rachel:,b' No-no! Don\x92t dance for me! Please? Don\x92t! (She gets up to yell\nat her \x91friends.\x92) What is the matter with you guys?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, okay, let\x92s talk it out.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x85 Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It\x92s you guys! Come\non! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!'"
Phoebe:,b' Then why did she ask us to\x85'
Rachel:,"b' I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually\nliked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all\nthe cash, (He nods) and-and y\x92know\x97(Feels Eldad\x92s hair)\x97Wow! You do\nhave very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through\nanymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly,\nand to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you! (Storms out.)'
Ross:,"b' So uh, have a great time down there.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?'"
Ross:,"b' It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,\nI-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it\x92s revealing which I\x92m\nfine with, no I\x92m concerned about your health, sun exposure.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, if what\x92s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you\nget 30, sometimes it\x92s-it\x92s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not\nit\x92s just milk.'"
Ross:,b' Really?'
Ross:,b' Okay. Cool.'
Ross:,b' Call me!'
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel, we\x92re sorry for pushing those guys on you.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh that\x92s all right! Y\x92know, I ended up having a really good\ntime. Y\x92know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and\nawareness.'"
Chandler:,b' So what was it for anyway?'
Rachel:,b' I wanna say a disease.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Joey:,b' I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on '
Rachel:,b' Huh. All right.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God, look! That\x92s Elizabeth!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh-oh Professor Geller.'
Joey:,"b' Ahh, to be 13 again.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
