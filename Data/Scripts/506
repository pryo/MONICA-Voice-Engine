Phoebe:,"b"" Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a\nfur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)"""
Joey:,"b' Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah! '
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers\nbloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)\nThat didn't happen, I made that up!"""

Ross:,"b"" Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things."""
Ross:,"b"" Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's\x97Emily thinks we should get all\nnew stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new."""

Joey:,"b"" (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's\nfurniture has got Rachel coodies?"""
Joey:,"b"" No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see\nRachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing."""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence\x85"""

Ross:,"b"" Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and\nit looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!"""
Phoebe:,b' Why?'
Ross:,"b"" Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh\nnew apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on\none side and Columbia on the other."""
Joey:,"b"" That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)\nWhich is great! I love to ride that rail!"""
