Rachel:,"b' (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma."""
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, yeah... It\'s... ""climax your way to better skin"".'"
Joey:,"b' So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.'"
Rachel:,"b' (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!'"
Joey:,b' Oh hey Rach!'
Rachel:,b' Yeah...'
Joey:,b' Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, well...'"
Joey:,"b"" Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!"""
Joey:,"b"" (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?"""
Joey:,"b"" What's the matter, Pheebs?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh... Mike\'s sister just invited me to a party tonight, he\'s gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don\'t worry! I asked him. He\'s totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he\'ll think that I\'m totally ok with seeing him!'"
Rachel:,"b"" Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"""
Phoebe:,b' Exactly!'
Rachel:,"b"" And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh,"""
Rachel:,"b"" Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, that'll be great!"""
Joey:,"b"" Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."""
Rachel:,"b"" That's not what we're gonna do!"""
Joey:,"b"" Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"""
Chandler:,b' (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"""
Chandler:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, DAMN IT!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"""
Joey:,"b' (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)'"
Rachel:,b' Not gonna find any clothes in there!'
Ross:,"b' (entering) Hey, you guys!'"
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,"b"" Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?"""
Ross:,"b' Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?'"
Joey:,"b"" Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"""
Ross:,"b"" Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today."""
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"""
Ross:,"b' Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).'"
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey guys!'
Ross:,"b"" Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me."""
Chandler:,"b' I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.'"
Ross:,"b"" It's in Barbados."""
Chandler:,b' But you come first!'
Rachel:,"b"" I'm there!"""
Joey:,b' Bye.'
Rachel:,"b' Bye, see ya. (she goes)'"
Chandler:,b' (sitting down on the couch) Ok.'
Joey:,"b' All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample."""
Ross:,b' So-so what did the doctor say?'
Chandler:,"b"" Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."""
Joey:,"b"" So you're ruling out surrogacy?"""
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b"" So, I don't have to learn what that means?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."""
Joey:,"b"" Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?"""
Chandler:,b' (stopping Joey) ah-ha!'
Ross:,b' How do you feel about all this?'
Chandler:,"b"" I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one."""
Joey:,"b' Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!'"
Ross:,b' (puzzled) What?'
Ross:,b' (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!'
Ross:,b' The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.'
Ross:,"b"" (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, that's not what you want..."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I'll take some of that."""
Rachel:,"b"" Pheebs, that's for men!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!"""
Rachel:,"b' On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.'"
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them."""
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!"""
Phoebe:,"b' (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?'"
Rachel:,b' Sure!'
Phoebe:,b' Ok!'
Rachel:,"b"" You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff."""
Phoebe:,"b' So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?'"
Rachel:,"b"" She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!"""
Phoebe:,b' Why?'
Rachel:,"b"" I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!"""
Phoebe:,b' Who else?'
Rachel:,"b"" Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."""
Phoebe:,b' You like Joey?'
Rachel:,"b' Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.'"
Phoebe:,b' (whispering) Oh my God!'
Rachel:,"b"" It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"""
Rachel:,"b' (annoyed) Oh, I get it!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."""
Rachel:,"b' I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' So can we keep this between us?'
Phoebe:,b' Sure!'
Rachel:,"b' Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,b' Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?'
Chandler:,"b' Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!'"
Chandler:,"b"" You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."""
Chandler:,"b"" (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"""
Chandler:,"b"" So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"""
Chandler:,"b' Well, we\'re talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he\'s intelligent, he\'s healthy, he\'s athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"""
Chandler:,b' Ok!'
Chandler:,b' (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."""
Rachel:,"b' Ok, great!'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!"""
Rachel:,"b' (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends."""
Rachel:,b' (comes out again) What!?'
Phoebe:,"b' (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!'"
Phoebe:,b' Ooh! We have a problem.'
Rachel:,b' Oh! What are we gonna do?'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!'
Rachel:,b' (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!'
Joey:,b' Hello?'
Ross:,"b' Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?'"
Joey:,"b"" No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?"""
Ross:,"b"" I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker..."""
Joey:,"b"" Oh! How's it going?"""
Ross:,"b' It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!'"
Joey:,b' What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!'
Ross:,b' Barbados.'
Joey:,"b"" Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"""
Ross:,"b"" What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder."""
Joey:,"b' Well, just wake him up!'"
Ross:,"b"" I can't! If he realizes that"""
Joey:,"b"" Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was"""
Chandler:,"b' So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!'"
Chandler:,"b"" You don't like him."""
Chandler:,b' Alright! Just follow my lead!'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"""
Chandler:,"b"" (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack."""
Chandler:,"b"" You know what's"""
Chandler:,b' I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?'
Chandler:,"b"" (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard."""
Phoebe:,b' Good plan.'
Rachel:,b' Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! I\'m sorry Rachel, I don\'t have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who\'s more over who""! (at which she walks away)'"
Rachel:,"b"" (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?"""
Rachel:,"b"" (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.'"
Rachel:,b' (after a pause) Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!"""
Rachel:,b' Yeah...'
Rachel:,b' (Looks ashamed) I try...'
Ross:,b' (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want'
Joey:,b' (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the'
Phoebe:,"b"" Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party."""
Joey:,"b"" Then don't go!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."""
Joey:,"b"" Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."""
Phoebe:,b' David?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! (they hug)'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. What-what are you doing here?'
Phoebe:,b' What happened?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?"""
Phoebe:,b' Good!'
Phoebe:,"b' (disappointed) Oh, good for you.'"
Phoebe:,b' Mike and I broke up.'
Phoebe:,b' Really?'
Phoebe:,"b"" I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!"""
Phoebe:,b' Well... (pause) no.'
Phoebe:,"b"" I'd love to."""
Phoebe:,b' Ok. (they walk away together)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.'"
Rachel:,"b"" No, that's David."""
Rachel:,b' (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.'
Chandler:,"b"" You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."""
Chandler:,b' Ok.'
Chandler:,"b"" I think we've found our sperm!"""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?'"
Chandler:,"b' Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, he's better!"""
Chandler:,b' Really? Are you sure?'
Chandler:,"b"" (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."""
Chandler:,b' So you know this leaves us with...'
Chandler:,b' How do you feel about that?'
Chandler:,b' Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.'
Chandler:,b' (smiling) Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' We are gonna be'
Chandler:,"b"" Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"""
Chandler:,"b' Hey, Zack!'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.'"
Chandler:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,"b"" My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."""
