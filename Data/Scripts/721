Chandler:,b' Do you realize you get louder each week?'
Chandler:,"b' I figured I\x92d buy those. Pat, I\x92d like to buy a vow.\n(Laughs)'"
Chandler:,"b' Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?'"
Chandler:,b' Do you happen to know what I\x92m going to say?'
Chandler:,b' (watching in her) (in his head) '
Chandler:,"b' (writing) Monica, there are no words\x85 (To Joey and Ross) There\nare no words! This should not be this hard!'"
Joey:,"b' All right, uh\x85 (To Ross) Oh hey, you\x92ve done this before Ross,\nwell what did you say when you made up your vows?'"
Ross:,"b' Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I\ndie. She made no such promise.'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You\nshould\x92ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!'"
Rachel:,b' Monica what? '
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,b' What is the emergency?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)'
Ross:,"b' Well, why don\x92t you just start with something simple. Like umm,\nMonica from the moment I met you, I '"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m not sure I can do that.'"
Ross:,"b' ...everyone, this is Chandler!'"
Chandler:,b' (seeing her) Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even\nthough we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.""'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, there\x92s a nuclear holocaust, I\x92m the last man on\nEarth. Would you go out with me?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well maybe you don\x92t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you\njust say something about, y\x92know, all the things that he\x92s taught you. Like\x85\n(They all try to think about one example and don\x92t succeed.) Or all the things you\ntaught him.'"
Chandler:,b' (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That\x92s one?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, y\x92know-y\x92know what, I was looking at it upside down.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that\ncould\x92ve meant.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica\x85'"
Chandler:,b' (writing) Monica\x85'
Joey:,"b' ""\x85when I look back over our time together\x85""'"
Chandler:,b' (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' Well, I can\x92t do everything! Look back over your time together.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.'"
Chandler:,"b"" You'll get one."""
Chandler:,"b"" All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are\nmarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no, no.'"
Chandler:,"b' (trapped) Uh, uh.'"
Chandler:,b' Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back\nof the chair he was sitting in)'
Chandler:,b' Nice try.'
Chandler:,"b' Look, Monica\x85'"
Chandler:,b' This is not going to work.'
Chandler:,b' You are so great! I love you!'
Chandler:,"b' Nothing! I said, I said ""You\'re so great"" and then I just, I\njust stopped talking!'"
Chandler:,"b"" No I didn't!"""
Chandler:,"b"" No I didn't!"""
Chandler:,"b"" No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"""
Chandler:,"b'\xa0 Y\x92know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, what if all my stuff was here?'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I\x92m\nsaying?'
Chandler:,b' Oh my God.'
Chandler:,"b"" Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!\xa0 Oh God,\nI thought\x85 (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I\nthought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing\nthat matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.\n(Starting to cry again.) And if you\x92ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life\ntrying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you\nmarry me?"""
Joey:,b' (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We\x92re dying out here!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, what have you guys been up to?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because\nJoey kept making inappropriate suggestions.'"
Joey:,"b' How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?'"
Ross:,b' How\x92s Monica coming along with her vows?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well let\x92s just say its.. she\x92s lucky she has a sweet ass,\n\x91cause she\x92s not so good at the writing.'"
Ross:,b' I can\x92t believe that in four weeks they\x92re gonnta be married!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well let\x92s just hope it works. Y\x92know, nine out of ten\nmarriages end in divorce?'"
Ross:,b' Phoebe that\x92s not true.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, you\x92re right. How\x92s the Mrs.?'"
Rachel:,b' I can\x92t believe they\x92ve been together for three years.'
Joey:,b' (shocked) Has it been that long?!'
Ross:,"b' Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.'"
Joey:,"b"" Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"""
Chandler:,"b"" I've had a very long, hard day."""
Joey:,"b"" Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"""
Chandler:,"b' Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.'"
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b"" Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about\nchicken."""
Chandler:,b' Hey Joe!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a '"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know why they didn\x92t just tell us.'
Joey:,b' I know! I mean it\x92s not like we weren\x92t cool about it.'
Joey:,b' (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!'
Joey:,b' How?! When?!'
Chandler:,b' It happened in London.'
Joey:,b' '
Chandler:,"b"" The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a\nbig deal out of it."""
Joey:,b' But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! '
Chandler:,"b"" No-no-no-no-no! You can't!"""
Joey:,"b' All right! Man, this is unbelievable!'"
Chandler:,"b' (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is\nabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)'"
Rachel:,b' Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around\nwondering what to do.)'
Phoebe:,"b"" (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts\nyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes\noff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"""
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,b' (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!'
Phoebe:,b' '
Rachel:,b' OH MY GOD!!!'
Phoebe:,b' '
Rachel:,"b"" Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!"""
Phoebe:,b' '
Rachel:,b' I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!'
Phoebe:,b' YOU KNOW?!!!'
Rachel:,"b"" Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop\nscreaming!!"""
Ross:,"b"" (entering) What's going on?"""
Rachel:,b' (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)\nHI!! Hi! '
Ross:,b' What?! What?!'
Rachel:,"b"" Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this\napartment!"""
Ross:,"b' Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe\nstarts jumping to divert his attention.)'"
Phoebe:,b' (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and\nRachel.)'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel\nknows?"""
Joey:,"b"" Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us\nknow that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would\nfinally be over!"""
Phoebe:,"b' Or, we could '"
Rachel:,"b"" All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."""
Phoebe:,b' Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She\npinches his butt.)'
Chandler:,"b"" (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate\nand the pinching!!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"""
Chandler:,b' Phoebe knows about us!'
Joey:,b' Well '
Joey:,"b' Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.'"
Joey:,"b"" And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!"""
Chandler:,"b' Ahh yes, the messers become the messees!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!\nHe wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"""
Rachel:,b' Are you kidding?!'
Phoebe:,b' No!'
Rachel:,"b' I can not believe he would do that to Mon\x97Whoa! (She stops suddenly\nand slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we\nknow?'"
Joey:,b' No.'
Rachel:,b' Joey!'
Joey:,b' They know you know.'
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with\nus?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,\nyou can't say anything!"""
Joey:,"b"" I couldn't even if I wanted to."""
Chandler:,"b' Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put\nlotion on her! '"
Chandler:,"b"" Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little\nmimic of her dance.)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" He's not backing down. He went to get lotion."""
Joey:,"b"" (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!"""
Rachel:,"b' Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler\nthe sooner this is all over and out in the open.'"
Joey:,b' Ooh!'
Rachel:,b' Okay!'
Joey:,"b"" I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!\nCan't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn\x92t rip off any buttons.'"
Joey:,"b"" It's not my first time."""
Chandler:,"b' Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, you're-you're going?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is\nshowcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.'"
Chandler:,"b"" (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very\nhappy we're gonna have all the sex."""
Phoebe:,"b"" You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now."""
Chandler:,b' Not if I kiss you first.'
Phoebe:,b' Ooh.'
Chandler:,"b"" Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."""
Phoebe:,b' Here it comes. Our first kiss.'
Chandler:,"b"" Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!"""

Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, you\x92re friend\x92s getting married, it\x92s gotta\nchange things.'"
Rachel:,b' You really think it would be that different?'
Phoebe:,"b' How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they\x92re gonna be having\nkids, and then they\x92re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.\nAnd then maybe they\x92re gonna have to leave the city to be near a '"

Ross:,b' That little naked guy would be me.'
Rachel:,"b' Aww, look at the little thing.'"
