Ross:,"b' (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)'"
Rachel:,"b' And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered\nto help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you\nknow out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.'"
Ross:,b' (laughs) Umm that\x92s\x85that\x92s a little misleading.'

Joey:,b' Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That\x92s right.'
Rachel:,b' You know you kissed me first.'
Ross:,b' What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me\nsignals all over the place!'
Rachel:,b' '
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross\nbegging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)'"

Rachel:,"b' Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, \x91cause maybe I\nneed to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? Y\x92know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.'"
Rachel:,"b' No please, show me how I begged you!'"
Ross:,"b' I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It\x92s an\nexpression.'"

Ross:,"b' Okay, listen I am not a pervert!'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your\nright hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!'"
Ross:,"b' Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here\x92s what\nhappened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a\nhalf ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. '"

Ross:,"b' Five to be lying, six.'"
Joey:,b' Six months? Whoa that\x92s rough.'
Ross:,"b' Well, I mean it\x92s not all bad. I\x92m learning to appreciate the\nuh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.'"
Joey:,b' The sky\x92s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!'
Ross:,"b' Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well\nokay\x97I\x92m scared for my health!'"

(Softly)\nAnd across the lake I saw\x85a beautiful woman\x85bathing herself\x85but she was\ncrying\x85'"
Ross:,b' (intently listening) Why?'

Ross:,b' Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?\n(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!'
Rachel:,b' Oh Ross!'
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' Thank God you\x92re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking\nto yourself?'
Ross:,"b' That\x92s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.'"
Ross:,"b' (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about\nthe camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, we\x92re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them\nagree.)'"
Ross:,b' What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!'
Joey:,b' Y\x92know what? This is not fair to her. Let\x92s just forget the\ntape!'
Ross:,"b' Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, ""You\x92ll show me right?"")\nNo!'"
Joey:,"b' You\x92re right. (Mouths, ""I know you\x92ll show me, right?)'"
Ross:,b' Joey! No!'
Joey:,"b' Loud and clear! (Mouths, ""You\x92ll show me,"" and nods.)'"
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn\x92t\ngive you real names either.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.'"
Phoebe:,b' Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)'
Chandler:,"b' I still don\x92t get it, we didn\x92t do anything wrong.'"
Chandler:,b' I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!'
Chandler:,b' Well maybe it was all of your questions.'
Chandler:,"b' The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!'"
Chandler:,b' (angrily) Was that another question?'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?'
Joey:,"b' Uh no Rach, he\x92s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it\ndoes, it sounds like an honest mistake.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped\nit? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of\nmy child, the porn king of the west village.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I\ndidn\x92t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I\nthought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with\nher shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all\nyell again.) You don\x92t want to see this do you?'
Rachel:,b' I am '
Phoebe:,"b' No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.'"
Ross:,"b' Forget it, she\x92s destroying it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay fine! Fine! We\x92ll just have to think of some other way to put\nthe whole \x91Who came onto who,\x92 thing to rest! Come on now, think!!'"
Ross:,"b' Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It\x92s Rachel\x92s tape and she can do\nwhatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.'"
Rachel:,b' I wanna see it.'
Ross:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b' Clearly you don\x92t want people to see this tape. Now I don\x92t\nwant people to see this tape either, but you so badly don\x92t people to see it makes me\nwant to see it. You see?'"
Joey:,b' (confused) Are we watchin\x92 the tape or not?!'
Ross:,b' I don\x92t want people to see it for your sake.'
Rachel:,"b' Ahh, I don\x92t believe you. I think you don\x92t want them to see\nyou begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)'"
Ross:,"b' Rachel, please\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Ah, a little preview!'"
Ross:,"b' Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high\nroad, because in about five minutes I\x92m gonna be saying\x85(He laughs and points at\nRachel sarcastically.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)'"

Rachel:,b' Kinda hurtin\x92 my hand though.'
Rachel:,"b' (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did\nthis. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica)\n""Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please,\ndrinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"" (She tilts her wine glass above\nand moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh!\nOh\x85oh-oh-oh\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Did you do '
Ross:,b' (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.'
Chandler:,"b' So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed\ninvitation down onto the table.)'"
Rachel:,b' (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems\nlike yesterday they just got engaged.'
Ross:,"b' (on tape) I know. Hey remember\x85remember the night they got engaged?\nHow uh, you and I almost\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would\x92ve\ngone through with it? Y\x92know, if we hadn\x92t gotten caught. Do you think we\nwould\x92ve done it?'"
Ross:,"b' (on tape) I mean I\x85I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn\x92t\nsure if you wanted to.'"
Rachel:,b' (on tape) Oh I wanted to.'

Ross:,b' And in about five seconds you\x92re gonna see why.'

Rachel:,"b' Okay, get ready to see some beggin\x92!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, you came on to Ross!'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
