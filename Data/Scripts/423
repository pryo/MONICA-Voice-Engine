Chandler:,b' Six-hour trip to London. That\x92s a lot of Monica.'
Rachel:,"b' Who are you saying ""check"" too?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only\ndid it the one time. But it was pretty weird.'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey! Are you ready yet?'
Ross:,"b' Oh! Got \x91em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!'"
Joey:,"b' It\x92s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than\nenthused Chandler and starts towards the girls\x92 apartment.)'"
Chandler:,b' You got your passport?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don\x92t want to lose that.'"
Joey:,b' Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)'
Chandler:,b' There it is.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, okay, but Rachel\x92s gonna be here too, can\x92t I just ask\nher this stuff?'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering, with Joey) All right! Let\x92s do it!'"
Joey:,b' Woo-hoo!!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, cheerie-o! '"
Joey:,b' London baby!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, \x91cause that\x92s not gonna get annoying.'"
Joey:,b' (louder) London baby!!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what? I was wrong.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, we\x92re all here! I guess we should get going!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on\nyour wedding, but I don\x92t\x97can\x92t get up.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, I\x92ll-I\x92ll come hug you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, have a great wedding!'"
Ross:,b' Thanks.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!'"
Chandler:,b' Hey! (Trots over)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it\x92s on the\ncounter in your apartment.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe\x92s book as Rachel comes in from her\nroom.)'
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) So, we\x92re off.'"
Rachel:,b' Have fun!'
Ross:,"b' Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can\x92t believe you\x92re not gonna be\nthere!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I know.'"
Ross:,b' So-so come! Why don\x92t you come?'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' To London! Come to London. Please? It\x92ll mean so much to me.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, well, I gotta work, I\x92m sorry.'"
Ross:,b' Why-why can\x92t you take a couple of days off?'
Rachel:,"b' Because, I can\x92t! Ross, I told you, no. I can\x92t.'"
Ross:,b' This is my wedding.'
Ross:,b' Fine. You\x92ll-you\x92ll watch it on video when we get back.'
Chandler:,"b' (entering, with Phoebe\x92s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go\nPhobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.'"
Phoebe:,b' (laughs) Thank you.'
Phoebe:,b' Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)'
Ross:,"b' All right, let\x92s go! Bye, Pheebs!'"
Joey:,"b' Bye, Pheebs!'"
Joey:,"b' London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, do you need a hug? You don\x92t have to bring me anything!'"
Joey:,b' Come on! Do something!'
Chandler:,"b' I am, I\x92m ignoring you.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All\nright, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his ""pop-up"" map of\nLondon. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, what the hell is that?'"
Joey:,"b' It\x92s London, baby! All right, the hotel\x92s here. (Points to the\nmap.) Wait. No, we wanna go\x85 No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I\x92m gonna have to\ngo into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!'"
Joey:,b' I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay. Listen-listen, we\x92re not gonna have to walk this way the\nentire time are we?'"
Joey:,"b' Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)'"
Ross:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?'"
Ross:,b' What?! No! No! That\x92s-that\x92s time-out!'
Ross:,"b' Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything\x92s gonna be great, okay? Come on.\nCome on.'"
Ross:,b' Um-hmm! Doesn\x92t that sound delicious at the last minute?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily\x92s parents got married\nhere.'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s all right! Everything\x92s gonna be all right.'
Ross:,"b' Uh-huh, I see that.'"
Ross:,b' What? What?'
Joey:,"b' All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I\x92ve ever seen.\nHey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,\nChandler?'"
Chandler:,"b' I think it\x92s great. It\x92s great. Y\x92know, they\x92re\nthinking of changing the name of this place.'"
Joey:,b' Really? To what?'
Chandler:,b' To Put the Camera Away!!!'
Joey:,"b' Man, '"
Phoebe:,b' Oh. Oh.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, honey! Don\x92t get up! What do you need?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, no. Oh, nothing.'"
Rachel:,b' Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I have a wedgie.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, that is all you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' So-so, what do you want for lunch?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t know. I guess we '"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I do. What\x92s the matter?'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I\nshouldn\x92t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.'
Phoebe:,"b' Eh, don\x92t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love\nwith was getting married\x85'"
Rachel:,b' (interrupting) Still in love with?! '
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m not in love with Ross!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.'"
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, I\x92m going to Ross\x92s wedding because he is my\nex-boyfriend and that would be '"
Phoebe:,b' We thought you knew!'
Rachel:,b' We?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!'"
Rachel:,b' You all know? Does Ross know?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no, Ross doesn\x92t know anything.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I can not believe you didn\x92t tell me!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, because we thought you knew!! It\x92s so obvious! God, that\nwould be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean.""'"
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on\nthe front of it.) Yeah. That\x92s the stuff. What do you think?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I don\x92t have to buy that, ""I\x92m with stupid""\nT-shirt anymore.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, look, you\x92re not really gonna buy that are you?\nDon\x92t you think you\x92ve embarrassed me enough for one day?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I embarrass you? '"
Chandler:,b' How can I answer that when I\x92m pretending I don\x92t know you?'
Chandler:,b' Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?'
Chandler:,"b' All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,\ny\x92know, you\x92re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.'"
Joey:,b' Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you\x92re gonna make me choose between\nyou and the hat? I choose the hat.'
Joey:,b' Thanks.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, wait. All right, that\x92s it, okay, I\x92m out of here. I\nam not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand\nand walks away trying to be cool.)'"
Ross:,"b' Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think\nwe\x92ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.'"
Ross:,b' Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?'
Ross:,b' She said what?'
Ross:,"b' Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents\nspent on this wedding? Do you my sister\x92s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that\npeople took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts\nhis pants on backwards.) This isn\x92t right.'"
Ross:,b' I can\x92t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?\n(Holds out his pants)'
Ross:,b' The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is\nwhen we\x92re getting married.'
Ross:,"b' No. I\x92m saying it\x92s now. (He starts putting on his pants,\nbackwards again.)'"
Ross:,b' There\x92s no \x91or\x92 in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!'
Ross:,"b' (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,\nwait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please\x97(He catches something important in the\nzipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' (depressed) Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?'"
Rachel:,b' Manhattan does not have enough stores.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, '"
Rachel:,b' You can?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.'
Rachel:,b' Um-hmm.'
Phoebe:,b' And a small piece of chocolate.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)'
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some\ngraveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,\nthe water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn\x92t feel like getting up. Okay,\nI\x92m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you\x92re going to remember all of\nthe bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.'"
Rachel:,b' I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I\nlove Ross, I think he\x92s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs\nit out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you\x92re with Ross\nokay and imagine that you\x92re kissing him. And you\x92re-you\x92re running your\nhands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross\nit\x92s some kind of grease, it\x92s\x97uck! Hah?'"
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,\nand y\x92know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let\x92s try\nsome uh, aversion therapy.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay?'
Rachel:,b' All right.'
Phoebe:,"b' So uh, now look at the picture\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, and umm\x85 (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the\nhead.) '"
Rachel:,b' Ow!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, how do you feel now?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I like '"
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Hey. (He nods at the hat.)'
Joey:,b' Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!'
Chandler:,"b' No-no-no, y\x92know what? I really shouldn\x92t have said that you\nwere embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn\x92t cool. And if it makes you feel any\nbetter, I\x92ve had a really lousy day.'"
Joey:,b' Me too.'
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' Noo!! I\x92ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!'"
Joey:,b' Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)'
Joey:,"b' (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.\n'"
Joey:,"b' (on tape) Oh, Chandler.'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s\x85 That\x92s was\x85'
Joey:,b' That\x92s Fergie baby!!'
Chandler:,b' How did you? How? How?'
Joey:,"b' Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?\nSo, I\x92m in my map and-and\x85(Ross enters) Hey!'"
Ross:,b' Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.'
Ross:,b' Am I?! And was it '
Chandler:,b' I\x92m gonna go to the bathroom.'
Joey:,b' Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)'
Ross:,"b' Hey-hey, since you\x92re the \x91fix-it\x92 lady, here\x92s a\npickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn\x92t want to have the wedding at\nall?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just\nbecause the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.'"
Ross:,b' Excuse me?'
Ross:,b' I don\x92t know. A month?'
Ross:,"b' I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were\njust doing the flying nun.'"
Ross:,b' Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?'
Ross:,b' Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)'
Chandler:,b' That was pretty intense huh?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn\x92t think that we just went in\nthere because we were uncomfortable being out here!'"
Chandler:,b' (glares at him) I hope he did!'
Phoebe:,b' Hello.'
Joey:,"b' (on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It\x92s Joey!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the\x97that looks just\nlike you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say \x91hi!\x92 but then I\nfigured, he doesn\x92t care if he looks like you.'"
Joey:,"b' That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the\nchick and the duck are doing?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, they\x92re having a '"
Joey:,"b' Kinda, but I\x92ve just been having way too much fun.'"
Phoebe:,b' So you\x92re not homesick yet?'
Joey:,"b' No, I don\x92t think so.'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, the seven of us miss you.'"
Joey:,b' Who\x92s seven?'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Ahh, the babies miss me?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, the pizza guy\x92s here!'"
Joey:,b' What? You ordered pizza without me?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. But y\x92know we were thinking about you, y\x92know we ordered\nthe Joey Special.'"
Joey:,b' Two pizzas?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.'"
Joey:,"b' Wait, well, where did you get it from?! '"
Ross:,"b' Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y\x92know fewer\nbricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles\x85'"
Ross:,"b' But-but, if you don\x92t love this, we\x92ll do it in any other place\nat any other time. Really, it\x92s fine, whatever you want.'"
Ross:,"b' And, I don\x92t know, if it starts to rain\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Pheebs?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,b' Do you remember where the duck food is?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s in the guys\x92 apartment under the sink. Why?'"
Rachel:,b' (enters with a bag packed) Because I\x92m going to London.'
Phoebe:,b' What?! What do you mean you\x92re going to London?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you\ndon\x92t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) '"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x97Rachel, you can\x92t go! Ross loves Emily!'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!\nHe deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s not why you\x92re going! You\x92re going because you\nhope he\x92s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British\nchippy.""'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh\x97Do you think he will?!'
Phoebe:,"b' No! Because he\x92s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if\nyou go, you\x92re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y\x92know,\nit\x92s too late! You missed you\x92re chance! I\x92m sorry, I know this must be\nreally hard, it\x92s over.'"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know what? No. It\x92s not over until someone says, ""I\ndo."" (Exits)'"
Phoebe:,"b' I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn\x92t\nstop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I\x92m carrying a litter.'"
Phoebe: ,b'Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily\x92s Parents\x92 house.'
Chandler: ,"b'Joey, it\x92s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,\nOkay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.'"
