Ross:,b' (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! '
Chandler:,"b' No, no, no. No-no-no. '"
Ross:,"b' What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? '"
Chandler:,"b"" No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all\nthe states in six minutes. """
Ross:,"b"" What? That's like insanely easy! """
Chandler:,"b"" Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least\none, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica). """
Ross:,b' What? You forgot fourteen states? '
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, okay, time's up! """
Rachel:,"b' All right, I got 48. '"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? """
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of\ncelery, and I have one: regular celery. '"
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in\x85vegetables,\nJoey? """
Joey:,"b"" Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. """
Ross:,"b' Wow, how many have you got? '"
Joey:,b' Fifty-six! '
Joey:,b' Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports\nteam! '
Chandler:,b' Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)\nThere you go. '
Rachel:,b' (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting? '
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,\nso he's spending Thanksgiving with her. """
Rachel:,"b' Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... your food is so\ndelicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. '"
Phoebe:,"b' Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have\nthat. (She gets up and heads for her room) '"
Ross:,b' Done! With time-a to spare. '
Chandler:,"b"" Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up\nRoss' pad) """
Ross:,"b' You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it\'s kinda disgraceful, that a\ngroup of well-educated adults and Joey can\'t name all the states. Did you ever see a map,\nor one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm? '"
Chandler:,"b' Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad) '"
Ross:,"b"" What? That's impossible. """
Joey:,"b"" 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? """
Chandler:,b' I am only '
Ross:,"b' No, just give me another minute. '"
Chandler:,"b"" Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,\nokay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. """
Ross:,"b' This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50\nbefore dinner. '"
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, but if you can't\x85no dinner! """
Ross:,"b"" You're on! """
Joey:,"b"" (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on\nthere that you don't have. """
Joey:,"b' But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? '"
Ross:,b' Pshhshhh!'
Chandler:,"b' Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe\nin your apartment. '"
Joey:,"b"" Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. """
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, why is your bag moving? '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, it's not! """
Rachel:,"b"" Seriously, it's moving! """
Joey:,b' What the hell is in there? '
Phoebe:,"b"" It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's\nbag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. """
Chandler:,"b"" I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like\nold pumpkins or something. """
Chandler:,b' Which smells delicious! '
Chandler:,b' What? '
Phoebe:,b' (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?'
Phoebe:,"b"" I'm sorry, who's this? """
Chandler:,"b"" Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! """
Phoebe:,"b"" No, there's no dog here? """
Phoebe:,b' Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)'
Phoebe:,"b"" (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're\nhere already? How are they doing this? """
Rachel:,b' (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here? '
Rachel:,"b' Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your\ngirlfriend? '"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I'm sorry. """
Ross:,b' Ohio!! Thank you! '
Chandler:,b' Huh! Where is the dog?!'
Ross:,"b"" What dog? There-there's no dog here. """
Joey:,b' Yeah that dog left! '
Phoebe:,"b"" There's no dog in here. """
Chandler:,"b' Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! '"
Phoebe:,"b"" No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the\ndog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I\nhave a dog in my room. """
Chandler:,b' What is it doing here? '
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She\nbends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.\nMay I please stay with you nice people?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5\nminutes, my throat will just close up! """
Phoebe:,"b"" That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days """
Chandler:,b' (gasping) Really? '
Chandler:,"b' Well, it still has to go, right?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, it's um\x85"""
Joey:,"b"" (interrupting him) Don't do it! """
Chandler:,"b' (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It\'s time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,\n""Do what you have to do"") Okay, I hate dogs. '"
Phoebe:,b' Are you crazy? '
Ross:,b' Are you out of your mind?'
Phoebe:,b' Why? '
Joey:,b' Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)'
Chandler:,"b"" They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are\nthinking, and that scares me a little bit. """
Ross:,"b' Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat\nout of my hand!!!'"
Rachel:,"b' Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? '"
Chandler:,b' (scared) Is there a puppy here? '
Chandler:,"b' (to Tag) Okay, you are new!'"
Joey:,"b"" Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's\nlike Ross not likin\x92 ice cream. """
Phoebe:,"b"" You don't like ice cream? """
Ross:,"b"" It's """
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. """
Ross:,b' (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.'
Chandler:,"b"" And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I\ndon't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An\nawkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!"""
Ross:,"b"" How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.\n"""
Ross:,"b' Damn, I forgot you were here. '"
Phoebe:,"b"" All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross\x92s. We'll be back in a\nminute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? '"
Rachel:,"b' When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount\nof time to wait before you make a move? '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I'd say about a month. """
Joey:,b' Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)'
Rachel:,b' Interesting. '
Joey:,"b"" All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because\nif he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. """
Rachel:,b' Huh. A moo-point? '
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. """
Rachel:,"b' (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did\nthat all just make sense?'"
Rachel:,"b"" You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. """
Joey:,"b"" Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is\nthis pretty, no one cares what's inside. """
Rachel:,b' Hey! '
Rachel:,b' How are you holding up? '
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. """
Rachel:,b' So were you guys together a long time? '
Rachel:,b' Now that she broke up with you? '
Rachel:,b' Yeah. Hmmmm. '
Rachel:,"b"" No\x85Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know\nthat I figure it\x85it has to work out. """
Rachel:,"b' Because, uh\x97it has to. '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. '"
Rachel:,"b' Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug) '"
Joey:,"b' (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you\nshould go for it! '"
Joey:,"b' (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel\nmoves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed) '"
Rachel:,"b"" Uh, yeah, well, see, he\x85 Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure\nabout my back and, and\x85you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,\nyeah!"""
Rachel:,"b"" No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what\nhe said, because um, I'm attracted to you. """
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's\ncrazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I\nwant to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be\nreally great if you said something right about now. """
Rachel:,b' What? '
Rachel:,"b"" Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you\nwanna get off your chest? """
Rachel:,"b"" (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and\nthey\x92re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh\nlook, there they go, okay. (She hurries in too) """
Phoebe:,"b"" (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. """
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, okay. '"
Phoebe:,"b"" You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't\neven know. """
Phoebe:,"b"" I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's\nnot so smart. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? """
Phoebe:,"b"" Where's Chandler? """
Chandler:,b' (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am. '
Phoebe:,b' Wash your hands!!!'
Chandler:,b' How did you\x85know? (Heads back into the bathroom) '
Ross:,"b"" Hey! What's she doing back here? """
Ross:,"b' Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... '"
Phoebe:,"b"" (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.\nOkay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. """
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, but, but look what I'm... """
Phoebe:,"b' See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her\nroom) '"
Chandler:,"b"" (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica? """
Ross:,"b"" Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. """
Chandler:,b' Why not? '
Ross:,"b"" Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. """
Chandler:,"b' Well, I, I should go in there. '"
Ross:,"b"" No. No, no. She doesn't want to see """
Chandler:,b' Why not? '
Ross:,b' Because you sent away the dog!'
Chandler:,"b"" This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom) """
Ross:,"b' Oh, is it? '"
Joey:,"b"" (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that\nChandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter? """
Chandler:,"b"" Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. """
Joey:,"b"" So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. """
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,\nw-w-what if, what if it attacks me? '"
Joey:,"b"" Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."""
Chandler:,"b"" And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out) """
Joey:,"b' Ross, you need some help? '"
Ross:,"b"" From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)\nYes, please! """
Joey:,"b"" (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make\nstuff up!"""
Ross:,"b' I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. '"
Joey:,"b"" Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. """
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I\nhave a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I\nfreaked him out '"
Joey:,"b' If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. '"
Phoebe:,"b' (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here? '"
Chandler:,"b' No, no he went for a walk. '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back! """
