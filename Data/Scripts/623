Chandler:,"b' Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I\ncan\x92t figure this out! It\x92s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)\nTiffany cut or a Princess cut or a\x97ah-ah! Paper cut!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Now, have you told anyone else?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I don\x92t want to tell anybody else because I don\x92t want\nMonica to find out.'"
Phoebe:,b' You told me.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, it\x92s because I trust you, you\x92re one of my best\nfriends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn\x92t\nbeen on the toilet.'"
Chandler:,b' Me too.'
Joey:,b' Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? '"
Chandler:,b' Oh all right.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, coffeehouse.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh well, we don\x92t because we got\x85the\x85other pl-place.'"
Ross:,b' How rude.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)'"
Phoebe:,b' So how are things going with Paul?'
Rachel:,"b' Good. Although y\x92know, he-he\x92s a private guy. Y\x92know, I\nwish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles\nthat won\x92t open.'
Rachel:,b' So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his\nhead against a table?'
Phoebe:,b' No that\x92s what you do when you want to get the truth out of\nsomeone.'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' (To Rachel) Watch this.'
Rachel:,b' (To Phoebe) Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Hi Paul!'
Phoebe:,b' So how are things going with you?'
Rachel:,b' Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)'
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,b' Great to see you!'
Ross:,b' How you doing?'
Ross:,b' Okay! You take care! '
Ross:,"b' Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off\nbefore?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! That was so weird, huh?'"
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, why\x92d you do it?'"
Phoebe:,b' I didn\x92t do it! It was Chandler! He\x92s\x85 He\x92s mad at\nyou!'
Ross:,b' What?! Why?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Please, I think you know why.'"
Ross:,b' I can\x92t think of anything.'
Phoebe:,"b' Come on Ross, you\x92re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.'"
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn\x92t invite him to that\nKnicks game a couple of weeks ago?'"
Phoebe:,b' Do you think that\x92s something that he\x92d be mad at you for?'
Ross:,b' I guess it could.'
Phoebe:,b' Well then I think that\x92s it.'
Ross:,"b' Well, if he\x92s angry, he really shouldn\x92t just cover it up. I-I\nwish he would just tell me the truth.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, if that\x92s what you want you then you really should run his head\nunder hot water and bang his head against a table.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah that\x92s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me\nabout your day.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah that\x92s great Paul, but y\x92know I wanna know\nwhat\x97(Puts her hands on his shoulders)\x97Wow, those are really great! I just wanna\nknow what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y\x92know they say that\nstill waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.'"
Rachel:,"b' No Paul, I don\x92t know anything about you! Y\x92know, like-like\nyour childhood! Tell me about your childhood!'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that\x92s always a painful\ntime! Y\x92know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand\nin warm water while you\x92re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, you\x92re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway,\numm\x85 The rest of you life, y\x92know? Any regrets?'"
Rachel:,"b' All right Paul, I\x92m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me\nsomething. Anything!'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' All right.'
Rachel:,b' Hm-mmm.'
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s-that\x92s great! See? I already feel like I know you a\nlittle better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let\x92s go. (Gets up to\nleave, but Paul doesn\x92t move.)'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really\ngreat that-that y\x92know, you shared your feelings. It\x92s really, it\x92s\nbeautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?'"
Rachel:,b' What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao\nChicken!'
Rachel:,"b' My God, I\x92m sorry! I\x92m sorry! I didn\x92t mean to do that! I\nwouldn\x92t do that!'"
Chandler:,b' Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we\x92ve been too and\nI can\x92t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts\npointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is\nwatching him.) It\x92s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so maybe you don\x92t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do\nsomething different. Y\x92know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y\x92know?\nOr an engagement tiara? Or\x97ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up\nfrom the display in the corner.'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know, I\x92m so glad I picked you to help me with this.'"
Phoebe:,b' Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this\ngorgeous piece of weaponry?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display\ncounter.) Oh, this one\x92s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,\nkind sir? Can I see this one?'"
Phoebe:,"b' (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,\nthis is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from\nhere on out.'"
Chandler:,"b' Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Or not, whatever.'"
Chandler:,"b' Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you\x85hold out that ring and ask\nme to marry you?'"
Chandler:,"b' (choking up) Oh my God that\x92s it, that\x92s the ring! How much\nis it?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much '"
Phoebe:,b' We will give you $10.'
Chandler:,"b' Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.'"
Phoebe:,b' We stand firm at $10.'
Chandler:,"b' Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I\nleft my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I\x92ll go get it. You guard the ring.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I\x92m sorry about before. Do you have\nanything her for $10.'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92ll give you $1 for them.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?'"
Joey:,b' No.'
Ross:,b' Remember? You-you were eating pizza.'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' Okay. Well, apparently Chandler\x92s angry at us for not getting him a\nticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, we\x92re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always\nmooching off of us!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,\ny\x92know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and\ninvite him.'"
Joey:,b' Oh wow that\x92s a great idea! And '
Ross:,b' Oh. (Starts to get his money) '
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther\nChandler\x92s card.) Y\x92know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just\x97I don\x92t get\nChandler. Y\x92know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don\x92t get\nall upset.'"
Ross:,b' All the time?'
Joey:,b' All the time!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Oh my God!!'
Rachel:,b' Like a '
Rachel:,b' What\x92s the other one?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh that\x92s right. You\x92re the talker. (They both reflect on that\nbriefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy\nhim some more tissues.'"
Rachel:,b' No you don\x92t!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay umm, I\x92d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler\nhands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too\nmuch?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He\nhands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something\x92s\nmissing. It\x92s not\x85 Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which\nlocks the store\x92s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!\nWhat?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)'"
Chandler:,b' No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)'
Chandler:,"b' No, did he hug you?!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m a little busy here Paul.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs\nChandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)'"
Chandler:,b' Okay! (Pushes him away.)'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, ""What\x92s going\non?"") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)'"
Chandler:,b' Do you have my credit card?'
Joey:,"b' Yes, it\x92s in my\x85 In\x85in my pocket. (Paul hasn\x92t dropped\nhim yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!'"
Chandler:,b' Thank God! (Grabs his card.)'
Joey:,b' Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I can\x92t go.'"
Joey:,"b' Come on! It\x92ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and\x85 Paul\nprobably\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, that\x92s uh, that\x92s pretty nice but I\x92m gonna go with\nthe one I picked first.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It\x92s over!'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' Some guy bought it. I\x92m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points\nto the jeweler) put me in jail!'
Chandler:,b' They put you in jail?'
Phoebe:,b' The little jail between the doors!'
Chandler:,"b' Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!'"
Phoebe:,"b' I know, I\x92m sorry! But y\x92know, this ring is better! Monica\nnever even saw the other ring.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.'
Phoebe:,b' Maybe it was the guy.'
Chandler:,b' It was the ring!'
Ross:,"b' Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?'"
Joey:,b' No! He blew us off!'
Ross:,b' What?!'
Joey:,b' I know!'
Ross:,b' I can\x92t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I\x92m a\nlittle mad at him now.'
Joey:,b' Can I tell you something? Me too.'
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? He didn\x92t want to talk to us about being angry,\nwell maybe we don\x92t talk to him '"
Joey:,b' Ooooh! Freeze him out.'
Ross:,b' That\x92s right!'
Joey:,b' I like it!'
Ross:,b' Eh? We\x92ll show him!'
Joey:,"b' From now on, it\x92s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake\nhands.) Okay! We\x92re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.'"
Rachel:,b' Hi. I\x92m back.'
Rachel:,"b' Ah that\x92s great. No actually that\x92s\x85 (In a sexy voice)\nThat\x92s great! That\x92s really great! Y\x92know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean\nwriting, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.'"
Rachel:,b' A lover?'
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah surfer?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the\ncounter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here.\nWait, now wait a second, this isn\x92t too revealing is it?'"
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t care about the little dude! I can\x92t! I cannot listen\nto anymore of this! Y\x92know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a\nmental health professional! And then it\x92s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do\nyou know how much money I could\x92ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know\nwhen I figured that out? While you were talking!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh\x85 I\x92m sorry. I\x85 I-I don\x92t mean\x97I didn\x92t\nmean to stifle you. I\x85 This is all just a little overwhelming.'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m so glad, I\x92m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.)\nAnd I\x92m glad that you\x92re done. What do you say we umm\x85 (Nods in the\ndirection of the bedroom.)'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering from her room) Hey.'
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball\nmachine looking ring!'
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It\x92s a\nbeautiful ring!'
Chandler:,"b' No, it\x92s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see\nMonica\x92s face when I gave it to her, y\x92know? And I could see her saying yes.\nWhen I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then\nI can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing\nI\x92m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it\x92s perfect.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.\n\x91Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we\ncan get him to trade rings or something.'
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t do that.'
Phoebe:,b' Well you certainly can\x92t give her that stupid gumball ring.'
Phoebe:,b' There he is! (Points.)'
Chandler:,b' Okay and he hasn\x92t proposed yet because she has no ring on her\nfinger.'
Phoebe:,"b' Wow! You\x92re good! After this, we should solve crimes.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me\nplease? You have a phone call.'"
Phoebe:,b' It is your office.'
Phoebe:,b' John?'
Phoebe:,b' (To Chandler) Here he is.'
Chandler:,"b' (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,\nthe ring you\x92re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I\x92m\ngonna need to have that back. (The guy isn\x92t sure.) But, in exchange I\x92m willing\nto trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! I would trade.'
Chandler:,b' No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.\nYou don\x92t want to break her heart now do you?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman\x92s heart?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, she\x92s dying\x85 Of a cough apparently.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I\x92m not\nburied with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all\neternity\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' (interrupting her) Okay, that\x92s enough honey!'"
Chandler:,"b' Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)'"
Chandler:,b' Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And '
Chandler:,"b' Guys? (They ignore him.) I\x92ve got something important to tell ya.\n(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to\ntry and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I\x92m gonna ask Monica to\nmarry me.'"
Joey:,b' (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.'
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)'"
Joey:,b' Oh my God!!'
Ross:,b' So you two are really serious?!'
Chandler:,"b' Yep, pretty much.'"
Ross:,b' You-you\x92re gonna get married?! I mean\x85 We\x92re gonna be\nbrothers-in-law! (They hug.)'
Joey:,"b' And-and-and-and-and-and, and we\x92re gonna be friends again! '"
Chandler:,b' (goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy\x97What?'
Joey:,"b' Oh it\x92s water under the bridge, forget it!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait \x91til uh, it was official\ny\x92know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you\x92re my best\nfriends.'"
Joey:,b' I think I\x92m gonna cry!'
Rachel:,"b' (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one\ncry baby, I\x92ll dump you too!'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m gonna ask Monica to marry me.'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so\nhappy!'
Chandler:,b' I know.'
Joey:,b' (holding an empty tissue box) Where\x92s all the tissues?! (Throws the\nbox down in disgust.)'
Chandler:,b' Check out the ring.'
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hi.'
Ross:,b' Hey-hey Pheebs!'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' Chandler\x92s gonna ask Monica to marry him!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.'"
Ross:,b' You told her before you told us?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can\nunderstand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game\non TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)'"
