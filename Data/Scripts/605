Rachel:,b' I cannot believe that you didn\x92t tell me that we are still\nmarried!!'
Ross:,b' Look I was going to tell you!'
Rachel:,b' When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross\ndidn\x92t get the annulment; we are still married.'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' (overdoing it) Oh my God!!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, maybe it wasn\x92t my best decision. But I just couldn\x92t face\nanother failed marriage.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this\nwas a successful marriage?'"
Ross:,"b' Rach, come on, if you think about it, it\x92s actually kinda funny. (He\nlaughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it\x92s best not to think about it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, '"
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, I told her you already knew.'"
Phoebe:,b' Another lie. You have a sickness!'
Chandler:,"b' Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you\x92re not married to\nanymore of us are ya?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche!\n{Transcriber\x92s note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If\nI had a Porsche, I\x92d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther,\nthese yours?'"
Joey:,b' Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?'
Joey:,b' There\x92s a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My\nshoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)'
Chandler:,b' You left a shoe here?!'
Joey:,"b' Well, I didn\x92t realize until I got home. I wasn\x92t gonna walk all\nthe way back down here with one shoe! Y\x92know what? I\x92m gonna go find that\nguy\x92s car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I\x92ll be sure to give\nhim your shoe.'"
Joey:,b' Great! Thanks. (Exits.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen,\nhow would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!'"
Chandler:,"b' (not enthused) Yeah, all right.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, well I\x92ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by\nthe way, they\x92re not actually puppies, they\x92re Frank and Alice\x92s triplets.\nOkay, see ya! (Exits.)'"
Chandler:,b' Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?'
Phoebe:,b' (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank\nand Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I\x92m nervous \x91cause I\x92ve\nnever done that before by myself!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m gonna pass. \x91Cause I was kinda iffy when it was\npuppies.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s not mine.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s (looks up and sees the woman) mine.'"
Joey:,"b' Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?'"
Joey:,b' (checks in the window to make sure it has them) It\x92s got \x91em!'
Rachel:,"b' So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross\x92s, '"
Phoebe:,"b' What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while,\nI don\x92t have a roommate.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.'"
Phoebe:,b' Maybe you could be my roommate!'
Rachel:,b' Well there\x92s an idea!!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,"b' That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, she said she\x92d be back December 26'"
Rachel:,b' December 26'
Rachel:,"b' (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the\nforms. I\x92ll take care of everything.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well sure, if you say you\x92re gonna take care of everything I have\nno reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now\nI\x92m gonna do this my way and I don\x92t want to hear a peep out of you!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay Rach, but\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Op! You\x92re peeping!'
Rachel:,"b' Ross! Y\x92know what, I just got\x97why? Why did you do this?!'"
Ross:,b' Look I told you\x85'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t wanna hear ""Three failed marriages!""'"
Ross:,"b' Look, if you\x92d had two failed marriages, you\x92d understand!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know what? Thanks to you I\x92m half way there! Ugh! Oh!\nI am so mad! Ross, I don\x92t think I have ever been this angry!'"
Ross:,b' What about the time I said we were on a break?'
Rachel:,b' Ugh! (Stares at him.)'
Phoebe:,b' (rapidly) I\x92m doing okay. I think it\x92s going well. Do you\nthink they\x92re having fun? Am I talking to fast?'
Chandler:,"b' Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right,\nCoach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly\nsmells something. It\x92s times like these I\x92m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn\x92t been\ninvented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you\x92re done over there, we kinda have a\nsituation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.'"
Chandler:,b' See that\x92s where I think that you\x92re wrong. We\x92ve been\nplaying these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.'
Chandler:,"b' I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our\nown zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y\x92know Mon, you can be in\ncharge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put\ntheir hands around\x85 (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his\nfinger.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, I\x92m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey guys!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Hey babies! Oh, I\x92m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche\nI\x92ve got the keys too, still there!'"
Chandler:,b' Shocking! Since you still have the keys.'
Joey:,"b' You should see the treatment I get when I\x92m with that car! People are\nfriendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about\nmy equity investments.'"
Chandler:,b' What equity investments?'
Joey:,"b' The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his\nforehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I\nfigured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they\x92re gonna start to\nthink that I don\x92t own it. So I figured I\x92ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a\nbucket and some soap I can borrow?'"
Chandler:,b' You don\x92t even have a car!'
Chandler:,b' And?'
Chandler:,b' There you are.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, she tops out at 130.'"
Joey:,b' And that\x92s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her\nupstate.'
Joey:,b' Sure!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, take it easy.'"
Joey:,"b' Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I\x92m just polishing her up.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, but it\x92s my wax.'"
Joey:,"b' Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I\x92ll uh, save your parking spot.'"
Joey:,b' Why not?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, so did I.'"
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don\x92t know\nwhy Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.'
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they\ncan meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)'"
Chandler:,b' He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!'
Phoebe:,"b' No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look\nat his smooth area, that\x92s just gonna mess them up.'"
Chandler:,"b' They\x92re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over\nprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!'"
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,"b' Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check\non the babies again.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I can still do that.'"
Chandler:,b' (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe\nyou\x92re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.'
Chandler:,b' I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.'
Phoebe:,b' How did that happen?!!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y\x92know? And it\nturns out I was wrong. And now it\x92s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to\ncough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.'"
Ross:,"b' Fine, I\x92m mentally unstable.'"
Ross:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b' Uh yes, heroin and crack.'"
Ross:,b' Crack isn\x92t even an intravenous drug!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, you would know.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, come on!'"
Rachel:,"b' (starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x92m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I\x92m not addicted to heroin,\nI\x92m not gay, and there is '"
Ross:,b' And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!'
Rachel:,b' Ugh!'
Rachel:,"b' Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!\n(To the stenographer) And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the\nrecord?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.'"
Ross:,"b' (stands up) That\x92s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with\nyour funny, funny form!'"
Rachel:,b' (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like\nbunnies nonsense!'
Ross:,b' And what\x97(notices the stenographer is still typing)\x97What are you\ntyping that for? Did you hear what she said? We don\x92t get the annulment. Don\x92t\ntype that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in\nthe process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He\x92s still typing.)\nStop typing! Stop typing!!'
Rachel:,"b' (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you\x92re keeping me\nmarried too?!'"
Rachel:,"b' All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I\nam not leaving here until I get one!'"
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,b' And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)'
Joey:,b' (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his\ncar back.'
Chandler:,b' But you found the keys to his clothes?'
Joey:,"b' No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I\nown a Porsche.'"
Joey:,b' Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn\x92t have the\ncar! Right?'
Chandler:,b' That is true.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I\x92ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to\nleave.)'"
Joey:,b' Come on! What are you doing?! I\x92m in character! Would you talk to\nher! (Storms out.)'
Chandler:,"b' Ahh, I think it just moved. It\x92s really poking me.'"
Phoebe:,"b' What?! No, you can\x92t, you can\x92t leave me here with them!\nWe\x92re baby-sitting! '"
Phoebe:,b' But you-you can\x92t leave me with them! We-we\x92re a team!\nWe\x92re playing a zone! They\x92re gonna triple team me!'
Phoebe:,"b' But no, because a doctor won\x92t be able to help him, it\x92s just\ngonna y\x92know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.'"
Chandler:,b' I think that\x92s gum.'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m pretty sure it\x92s gun.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, listen this really hurts. Let\x92s go.'"
Phoebe:,"b' A real man wouldn\x92t just run to the hospital! (They don\x92t\nstop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)'"
Joey:,b' Why isn\x92t that valet back with my Porsche?'
Joey:,b' (to women passing him) Porsche.'
Rachel:,b' This is totally your fault!'
Ross:,b' My fault?! You threatened the judge!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter\x92s machine!!'"
Ross:,b' That was the only way I could get him to '
Joey:,b' Hi! How are the Gellers? '
Rachel:,b' Don\x92t call us that! (Storms away)'
Ross:,b' The judge wouldn\x92t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a\ndivorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)'
Joey:,b' Hey! It\x92s Porsche!! (He\x92s right y\x92know.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right?\nOkay, I\x92m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get\nrid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I\x92ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at\nthe garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the\nfloor and break.) Okay, I\x92m sorry. I didn\x92t mean to scare you. I just have to\nclean that up. Okay? \x91Cause let\x92s face it, we\x92re at Monica\x92s. (She\ncrawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All\nright. Well, that\x92s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the\nvase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two\nof you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can\x92t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie?\nWhere are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a '"
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' (exhausted) How do you feel?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, let\x92s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy\nthe universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so I '"
Chandler:,b' And protected them from a tornado?'
Phoebe:,"b' I know, the babies are asleep.'"
Phoebe:,b' I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!'
Chandler:,b' Was the setting of Phoebe\x92s triumph.'
Chandler:,b' Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies\nall by herself.'
Chandler:,"b' (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!'"
Rachel:,"b' (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you\x92re home, I was getting worried.'"
Ross:,"b' I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I\x92ve already signed everything\nand I put little \x91X\x92s where you need to sign.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, little \x91X\x92s! Great! That makes up for everything!'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, I-I\x97you\x92ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you\ntold me you loved me '"
Rachel:,b' Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was\nin love with you!'
Ross:,b' Yeah! Right!'
Ross:,"b' You\x92re right. That\x92s very different. So let\x92s, let\x92s\njust sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?'"
Rachel:,b' Nothing. (Sits down.)'
Ross:,"b' Okay, can we just sign please?'"
Rachel:,"b' Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page\nout of the way.)'"
Ross:,b' Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)'
Rachel:,"b' Okay Ross, we\x92re\x97wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a\nlittle confession.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.'"
Ross:,b' Excuse me?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we\nwere married?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,"b' And uh, yeah, I didn\x92t really, I didn\x92t want to say anything,\nbut it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the\ncasino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I\nthought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first\nto get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us\ninto this mess.'"
Ross:,"b' So then if-if\x97I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your\nfault.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, don\x92t push it though.'"
Ross:,"b' I\x92ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I\nwould be divorcing you.'"
Rachel:,"b' I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one\nthat stuck. And it wouldn\x92t be a secret, and we wouldn\x92t have our wedding dinner\nat '"
Ross:,"b' Did I, did I even treat?'"
Rachel:,"b' No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.'"
Ross:,b' That may be the most depressing thing I\x92ve heard in my life. I should\nprobably get these to my lawyer\x92s office.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.'"
Ross:,"b' Eh, no problem.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m gonna need a copy of those.'
Ross:,b' Totally. (Exits.)'
Joey:,b' Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! '
Joey:,b' Hey! How you doin\x92?'
Joey:,"b' I\x92d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She\x92s sleeping.\n(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the\nsame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses\nit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)'"
