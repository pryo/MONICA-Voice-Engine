Ross:,b' Hey! '

Phoebe:,b' Joey stuffing 15 '
Ross:,b' 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an '
Phoebe:,b' Where were you?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum\nupstate.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, which museum?'"
Phoebe:,"b' (just Phoebe) No, answer his.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the\ndoor, so she\x92d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my\nmercy.'"
Chandler:,b' Were you so late because you were burring this woman?'
Ross:,"b' No, I\x92m getting back down \x91cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She\nseems really great, but she\x92s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours\naway.'"
Chandler:,"b' How can she be great if she\x92s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they\nall look at him) That joke would\x92ve killed in Albany.'"
Joey:,"b' Done! I did it! Heh, who\x92s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie\nremains all over his teeth.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They\x92re lighting the big\nChristmas tree tonight.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, that paper\x92s two weeks old. '"
Chandler:,"b' All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really\nwanted to take Kathy to this, I can\x92t believe I missed it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, y\x92know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I '"
Chandler:,b' Really?! I didn\x92t think girls ever just wanted a fling.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, believe me, it\x92s been a long time since I\x92ve been flung.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I know what I\x92m giving you for Christmas.'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know what? There\x92s some nice guys at my office, do you\nwant me to set you up?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah! Wait a minute, it\x92s been a long time that I\x92ve been\nsingle. How come you never offered this before?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I have a girlfriend, I\x92m-I\x92m happy. So, I no longer\nfeel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don\x92t like\nguys with boring jobs.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?'
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s wrong Mon?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, maybe they meant to write, \x91Quiet, bitch.\x92'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, honey! What\x92s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I\nwas just trying to be nice! Whoa!'"
Joey:,b' Ohhh!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, wait a minute, you\x92re the boss! Why don\x92t you just yell\nat them? Or, fire them?'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,\nI think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so\nhe could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who\x92s boss.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, Mon! I\x92m not doing anything, why don\x92t you fire me?'"
Joey:,b' Good enough to get fired.'
Joey:,b' Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy\ndirect '
Chandler:,b' (he glares at him for a while) Yes.'
Chandler:,"b' I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)\nOg-ee-op, I\x92m not asking for me, I\x92m\x85 I mean\x85 No, I\x92m-I\x92m\nnot gay, I\x92m not asking you out. I\x92m not-I\x92m not-I\x92m not gay!'"
Chandler:,"b' See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, y\x92know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a\nfling, that might be all right with Rachel.'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh well, that\x92s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to\nstay, but sure!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I don\x92t really know what that is, but '"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! You guys, I\x92m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want\nto hear it?'"
Phoebe:,b' (singing) '
Rachel:,"b' Pheebs, that\x92s great!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, yay!'"
Rachel:,"b' But y\x92know umm, Rachel doesn\x92t rhyme with draddle.'"
Phoebe:,b' I know but it\x92s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!'
Joey:,b' What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.\nJail. Bail. Able. May-pole.'
Phoebe:,"b' All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a\nnickname that\x92s easier to rhyme?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah!'
Phoebe:,"b' Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Hello, children!'"
Chandler:,b' (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!'
Rachel:,b' Really?!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing\nthemselves at me! They\x92re buying me drinks! They\x92re giving me stuff! (to Joey)\nKnicks tonight?'"
Joey:,b' Sure! Where are the seats?'
Chandler:,b' Wherever! I\x92ve got like 20!'
Rachel:,"b' So, will I like any of these guys?'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know what, I\x92m gonna uh, play the field just a little\nmore.'"
Rachel:,b' Chandler!'
Chandler:,b' Guys are signing over their 401-K\x92s to me?'
Phoebe:,b' (shocked) You work with robots!!'
Chandler:,"b' (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there\x92s this one guy, Patrick, I\nthink you\x92re gonna like him, he\x92s really nice, he\x92s funny, he\x92s a\nswimmer.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, I like swimmer\x92s bodies!'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit\ncards.'"
Rachel:,"b' Op, I like credit cards!'"
Chandler:,"b' See, I\x92m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, so what does he do?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.'"
Rachel:,b' Your company has a fine foods division?'
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s a big company, I don\x92t\x97if you\x97I\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Now, wait a second! You make food '"
Phoebe:,"b' No! No, the robots just work for them.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, what are you gonna do? You\x92re gonna fire me?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh yeah! With who?'
Ross:,b' You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can\x92t decide\nbetween the two of them. Y\x92know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she\x92s a\ntwo hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this\nother girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y\x92know she\x92s, well\nshe\x92s-she\x92s just as pretty, I guess she\x92s smart, she\x92s '"
Phoebe:,"b' If she\x92s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y\x92know? She lives so\nclose. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that\nwas\x97if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn\x92t kidding,\nshe\x92s not fun, she\x92s stupid, and kind of a racist.'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, man!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?'"
Joey:,b' (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)'
Joey:,b' (entering from the dining room) Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, what happened to your fancy chef\x92s jacket? (sees there\x92s a\nburn spot on it)'"
Joey:,"b' You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens\nto be over her breast.)'"
Joey:,b' It\x92s still a tiny bit on fire there.'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, like father, like son.'"
Rachel:,b' Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this\ncould maybe turn into something serious.'
Chandler:,b' Really?! I-I thought you weren\x92t looking for something serious? I\nthought you were looking for some kind of a fling.'
Rachel:,"b"" Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn\x92t tell him that, though?\nRight?"""
Chandler:,"b' Ummmmmmmm, no.'"
Rachel:,b' You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don\x92t tell\nthe guy that!'
Chandler:,b' Why not?! I\x92d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just\nlooking to get\x97oh I see.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting\nout on the first date\x97oh, he\x92s so gonna get the wrong idea.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah. Listen uh, I\x92d prefer it if you didn\x92t call me Joey. Since\nI don\x92t know anyone here, I thought it\x92d be cool to try out a cool work\nnickname.'"
Joey:,b' (opening an envelope) There\x92s like-there\x92s like 300 bucks in\nthis one!'
Joey:,b' No ma\x92am.'
Joey:,"b' I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there\nwith 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,\n""Wow! It\x92s been a long time since I had\x85 (tries to do the math in his head,\nbut can\x92t) 327 + 238 dollars!""'"
Joey:,"b' And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don\x92t fire me,\ninstead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they\x92ll start listening to all the nice\nthings I\x92ve been saying about you.'"
Joey:,"b' Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' (interrupting) Oh, y\x92know, y\x92know what Pheebs?'"
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m not Jewish, so\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' So! Ross doesn\x92t '
Chandler:,b' Bad dream?'
Ross:,b' I wasn\x92t sleeping.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe\x92s song about?'"
Ross:,"b' The one with the cat. I gotta go, I\x92ve got another date.'"
Phoebe:,"b' So, did you pick one yet?'"
Ross:,"b' No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a\ndifferent joke than I thought\x97it wasn\x92t that funny. So I\x92m still torn.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well look, you don\x92t really like the one from uptown and\nyou\x92re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end\nthem both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your\nway back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you\x92re\ndone!'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, you\x92re right. Thank you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.'"
Chandler:,b' Prague?'
Phoebe:,b' There\x92s sooo much you don\x92t know.'
Rachel:,"b' Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not\ntell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?'"
Chandler:,b' I did! I absolutely did!'
Rachel:,b' You idiot!!'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sure you\x92re right, but why?'"
Rachel:,b' You don\x92t tell a guy that you\x92re looking for a serious\nrelationship! You don\x92t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, man. I\x92m sorry, I\x92m so-so sorry.'"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, you should '"
Chandler:,b' I know! I know!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh! See just I\x92m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being\nalone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, y\x92know, you\x92re-you\x92re gonna meet somebody!\nYou\x92re a great catch! Y\x92know when I was telling all those guys about you, I\ndidn\x92t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)'"
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?'"
Rachel:,b' No.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, it doesn\x92t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,\ny\x92know what, I\x92ve got two tickets to tonight\x92s Rangers game, you wanna come\nwith me?'"
Rachel:,b' Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, actually it\x92s a hockey team, so it\x92s angry Canadians\nwith no teeth.'"
Rachel:,b' Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)'
Chandler:,b' Have you ever been with a woman?'
Rachel:,"b' What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!'"
Chandler:,b' So there is no good time to ask that question.'
Joey:,b' (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y\x92know that little speech you made\nthe other day? Well I got a problem with it!'
Joey:,"b' You bet I do! I just ah, wasn\x92t listening then, that\x92s all.'"
Joey:,b' What are you gonna do? You\x92re gonna fire me?'
Ross:,b' (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting\nnext to him)'
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!'
Ross:,"b' Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?'"
Joey:,b' Well I guess I should\x92ve thought about my wife and kids before I\ntalked back to chef Geller!'
Joey:,b' Yep! Looks like it\x92s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon\nhouse this year.'
Joey:,b' (leaving) Lean-lean-lean!'
Phoebe:,"b' (singing) ""'"
