Phoebe:,"b' Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent\x92s\nanniversary party?'"
Ross:,b' Sure. Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' So, who\x92s the guy?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said\nthat?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, he\x92s really great though. He has this incredible zest for\nlife, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty\ngirl I am.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, hopefully this time mom won\x92t boo you.'"
Chandler:,b' And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?'
Joey:,"b' Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to\nhimself) I\x92m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)'"
Joey:,b' Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I\ncan\x92t do it with you guys watching me!'
Chandler:,b' What are you doing?'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s a dog.'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s your parents\x92 anniversary and you\x92re going to talk\nabout their dead pet?'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35'"
Ross:,b' Aww that is so cool.'
Joey:,b' And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,\ngingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.'"
Ross:,"b' (picking up Chi-Chi\x92s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!\nY\x92know Monica couldn\x92t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.'"
Ross:,b' You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Ha!'
Ross:,"b' Ah, actually, I\x92m sorry we-we probably should get going.'"
Rachel:,"b' I, uh, think you already are.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, there is an '"
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' So uh, he seems like a nice guy.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.'"
Ross:,b' Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, otherwise I\x92m not going.'"
Ross:,b' Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.'
Rachel:,"b' This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have\nany pearls of wisdom? '"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s a good question, dad. That\x92s a good question\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Hmmm\x85.'
Rachel:,b' Thank you\x85we\x92re so excited'
Ross:,b' Wha\x97What?'
Ross:,b' Dad so what we have to pretend that we\x92re married?'
Ross:,b' Can you believe that?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, if you\x92re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass\nat the nosal area.'"
Ross:,"b' No, us having to lie about being married.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, I know I don\x92t either, but ya know what, it\x92s their party,\nand it\x92s just one night. And we don\x92t even have to lie; we just won\x92t say\nanything. If it comes up again, we\x92ll just\x85smile. We\x92ll nod along.'"
Ross:,"b' Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan'"
Rachel:,b' Oh\x85'
Rachel:,b' (looking at the check) Unbelievable!'
Ross:,b' We love marriage!'
Ross:,b' Hey'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t think the flash went off.'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92ll go with you'
Chandler:,b' Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge\nbutterfly net looking for that man.'
Joey:,"b' I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don\x92t want him complimenting\nmy thing.'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m so we weren\x92t in the car! Did he ever let up?'
Ross:,b' (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must\ntake a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry\x85(He looks behind him then\nnotices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)'
Phoebe:,b' Were you guys making fun of Parker?'
Ross:,"b' That depends, how much did you hear?'"
Phoebe:,"b' So, he a little enthusiastic, what\x92s wrong with that?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you\x92ve dated?\nTag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don\x92t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do\nyou want it? \x91Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the\nwho\x92s who of human crap. (Walks off)'"
Joey:,b' I know'
Ross:,b' What was wrong with Mona?'
Rachel:,b' Open it! Open it! Open it!'
Ross:,b' Yeah baby!'
Ross:,"b' No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small\nwedding.'"
Rachel:,"b' But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.'"
Rachel:,"b' On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, Stevie\x92s an old family friend. (Hits Ross\x92s chest)'"
Rachel:,b' So would I. You wouldn\x92t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to\nput film in the camera.'
Ross:,b' Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)\nUmm\x85. what are you doing?'
Rachel:,b' What? I\x92m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want\nit to be amazing.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a '"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, I\x92m fine. I\x92m great. I\x92m with you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hm huh, yeah.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, that\x92s not necessary.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, actually I don\x92t eat\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while\ndropping it on the floor) Mmm\x85hmmmmm\x85.'"
Phoebe:,b' Why don\x92t you just try one?'
Chandler:,b' What are you doin\x92?'
Chandler:,"b' Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could\n(Punches the air).'"
Rachel:,"b' And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even\nthough they lost their sight, it was all worth it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I don\x92t know about that, but some said that I looked like a\nfloating angel.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah. That\x92s a great story.'
Ross:,"b' Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.\nThat\x92s-that\x92s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room\nfilled with lilies, her favorite flower\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Shhh! I want to hear the rest!'
Ross:,"b' Then, Fred Astaire singing '"
Rachel:,"b' And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were\nbeing jerks. Parker\x92s a nice guy and I\x92d like to get to know him.'"
Phoebe:,b' Then you better do it now.'
Joey:,b' Why?'
Phoebe:,b' Because I\x92m going to kill him'
Joey:,b' What-what? '
Phoebe:,"b' You guys were right. He\x92s just too excited about\x85everything. I\nmean I\x92m all for living life, but this is the Geller\x92s 35'"
Joey:,"b' I know I\x92m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the\nbuffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!'"
Phoebe:,b' Are you sure it wasn\x92t an oyster?'
Joey:,"b' I guess it could\x92ve been, I didn\x92t really look at it.\nY\x92know, I just wiped it on Chandler\x92s coat and got the hell out of there.'"
Phoebe:,b' He\x92s just such a great guy I\x92m so excited about him.'
Joey:,"b' Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There\x92s nothing wrong with\nhim he\x92s a good guy. '"
Phoebe:,b' You think?'
Joey:,b' Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.'
Phoebe:,"b' You\x92re right. You\x92re right, he\x92s just embracing life. We\ncould all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I\x92m a\nsunny, positive person. '"
Joey:,"b' Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.'"
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s that now?'
Joey:,b' Nothing\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Oh look it\x92s Parker! '
Phoebe:,b' Oooh I love it!'
Phoebe:,b' Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, no, Mom, it\x92s just Monica this year.'"
Ross:,"b' No, of course, Um\x85 Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say\x85on\nbehalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that\nif\x85if in 35 years, we\x92re half as happy as you guys are, we\x92ll count\nourselves the luckiest people in the world.'"
Phoebe:,b' Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? '
Phoebe:,b' Oh thank God. '
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don\x92t we just um, sit and\nrelax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! '"
Phoebe:,"b' Let\x92s try something else, let\x92s play a game.'"
Phoebe:,b' Shocking! Let\x92s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.\n(Giggles)'
Phoebe:,"b' But, let\x92s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first\nloses! '"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! Oh my God! '
Phoebe:,"b' Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn\x92t perfect?\nEverything isn\x92t magical? Everything isn\x92t a glow with the light of a million\nfairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! '"
Phoebe:,b' You don\x92t have to put a good spin on everything.'
Phoebe:,"b' No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at '"
Phoebe:,b' Much less happy!'
Phoebe:,b' So long! Don\x92t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on\nyour way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)'
Phoebe:,b' Uh huh. (Closes door)'
Ross:,"b' \x85and then, we could\x92ve gone from the ceremony to the reception\nwith you in the sidecar!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, it just wouldn\x92t have been feasible.'"
Ross:,b' But having a dove place the ring on your finger would\x92ve been no\nproblem?'
Rachel:,b' It was really fun being married to you tonight. '
Ross:,"b' Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I\x92ve ever made.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' That proposal, at the planetarium\x85'"
Ross:,"b' I know, I know it was stupid. '"
Rachel:,"b' Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the\nstars! It was\x85really wonderful! Did you just make that up? '"
Ross:,"b' No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It\x92s\nhow I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. '"
Rachel:,"b' Well, that would\x92ve been very hard to say no too. '"
Ross:,"b' It\x92s a good thing I didn\x92t do it, because it sounds like it\nwould\x92ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night'"
Rachel:,b' Goodnight'
Ross:,b' Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn\x92t get messed\nup? '
Rachel:,b' I will think about it. '
Ross:,b' That\x92s all I\x92m askin\x92 '
Ross:,b' Y\x92know I don\x92t understand why they didn\x92t cry. It was a\nbeautiful speech. '
Ross:,"b' Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we\ndid learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.\nAnd what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would\x92ve wanted to be there. And\nyou know what? I think she was. '"
