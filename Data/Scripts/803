Joey:,"b' Well that, that sounds good.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what\x92s-what\x92s the first thing\nthat I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, bye.'"
Joey:,b' Bye.'
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Hey, what was that all about?'"
Chandler:,b' (in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn\x92t even know that\x97Why\ndidn\x92t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!'
Chandler:,b' (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent\nsecret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.'
Joey:,b' What secrets?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent\nsecret keeper.'"
Joey:,b' (whispering to Chandler) You\x92ll tell me later?'
Chandler:,b' You already know.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."""
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a\nbaby. Maybe you and I should do something.'"
Phoebe:,b' All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar\nin their apartment. Well you can let me in later.'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t have a key, they took mine to give to you.'"
Phoebe:,b' What?! They took mine to give to you!'
Joey:,b' Why would they take away our keys?'
Phoebe:,b' Maybe they don\x92t trust us.'
Joey:,b' No that\x92s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out\nof town. '
Phoebe:,b' You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with\nMonica\x92s guest towels?'
Joey:,"b' Hey, I washed those!'"
Phoebe:,b' No you didn\x92t.'
Joey:,b' Yeah that didn\x92t sound like me.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I have stuff in there too.'"
Phoebe:,b' What stuff?'
Joey:,"b' Monica\x92s chicken parm! I\x92ll take care of it. (He picks up the\nphone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it\x92s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and\nChandler\x92s apartment. It\x92s an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and\nbring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Did Rachel find you?'
Ross:,b' No why?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh she was looking for you.'
Ross:,"b' Oh well, I guess I\x92ll catch up with her later.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it seemed pretty important.'"
Ross:,b' Oh no.'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' I think I might know what this is about.'
Joey:,b' Really?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren\x92t gonna tell anybody this but uh,\nabout a month ago Rachel and I slept together.'"
Phoebe:,b' (deadpan) And?'
Ross:,b' Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!'
Ross:,"b' Well, we-we said we\x92d just do it that one time but, but now I think\nshe may wanna start things up again.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I don\x92t think that\x92s what it is.'"
Ross:,b' Why? What-what else could it be?'
Joey:,"b' Oh wow, I don\x92t feel well.'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m telling you. I\x92m telling you. That\x92s what it is. No\nwonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn\x92t say anything to\nyou?'
Phoebe:,b' (To Joey) Maybe it\x92s something you ate?'
Joey:,"b' Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y\x92know what I have to\nrealize? Maybe I\x92m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.\nY\x92know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He\npauses and then exits.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh honey, leave them alone, they\x92re in love.'"
Chandler:,b' We '
Chandler:,"b' 25J and K, any chance those aren\x92t together?'"
Joey:,b' I still can\x92t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.'
Phoebe:,b' Of course I do! And I\x92m gonna give it back to you as soon as\nthey\x92re done with it at the key shining place.'
Joey:,b' What the hell is that?'
Joey:,"b' Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,b' Well why don\x92t you use your key?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! We could have done that.'
Chandler:,b' No.'
Chandler:,b' Just act like you belong.'
Chandler:,b' Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They\ntries to walk past him.)'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh that\x92s all right, I have it memorized. It\x92s 1A.'"
Chandler:,b' Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)'
Rachel:,b' (seeing him) Hi!'
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,"b' Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there\x92s something that we\nreally need to talk about.'"
Ross:,"b' (quietly confident) I think we do. Why don\x92t we go inside? (They go\ninside.) Look uh, I know why you\x92re here.'"
Rachel:,b' You do?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should\ntalk first.'"
Rachel:,b' (warily) Okay.'
Ross:,"b' Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross.\nThat\x92s been one heck of a see-saw hasn\x92t it?'"
Rachel:,b' (confused) What?'
Ross:,"b' I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and\x85and certainly\npassionate, but don\x92t you think it\x92s better if we just stayed friends?'"
Rachel:,b' Seriously. What?!'
Ross:,"b' Okay. Okay. Y\x92know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time.\nI mean I\x92d-I\x92d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, y\x92know what? Can I, can I talk now?'"
Ross:,b' Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)'
Rachel:,"b' (touches his knee) I\x92m pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is\nstaring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you\x92re ready.\n(Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you\x92re the father by the way\x97but you got\nthat\x85'"
Rachel:,b' (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?'
Ross:,b' I\x92m good. I\x92m good.'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as\nyou want. (Ross nods.)'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I need uh\x85 I\x92m just\x97I don\x92t know\x97I\ndon\x92t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.'"
Rachel:,"b' I know. I know, but y\x92know condoms only work like 97% of the time.'"
Ross:,b' What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!'
Rachel:,b' They do!'
Ross:,b' No they don\x92t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with\nhis box of condoms.) Well they should put it in '
Rachel:,b' Okay Ross come on let\x92s just forget about the condoms.'
Ross:,b' Oh well I may as well have!'
Rachel:,"b' Listen, y\x92know what? I was really freaked out too when I found\nout\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Freaked out? Hey no, I\x92m not freaked out! I\x92m '"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know what? Let\x92s, let\x92s talk later.'"
Ross:,"b' No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I\x97In fact, (picks up the phone) I\nam going to talk to the president of the condom company!'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, y\x92know maybe I should come back\x85 (Starts to leave.)'"
Ross:,b' (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!'
Rachel:,b' (stops) Okay.'
Ross:,b' (on phone) Yeah I\x92ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to\nescape.)'
Joey:,b' (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and\nMonica about this? \x91Cause y\x92know umm, they don\x92t-they don\x92t have any\nkids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh no.'
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,b' Sure.'
Ross:,b' Namaste. (Bows.)'
Ross:,b' Oh my God! What happened to the door?!'
Joey:,b' So it\x92s noticeable huh?'
Ross:,"b' Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.'"
Phoebe:,b' Didn\x92t you two already talk?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah but uh\x85 Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept\ntogether, but there\x92s something else. (Pause) Rachel\x92s pregnant.'"
Joey:,b' (simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can\x92t believe that!!'
Phoebe:,b' (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!'
Ross:,b' With my child.'
Phoebe:,b' That is brand new information!!'
Ross:,b' You already know don\x92t you?'
Phoebe:,b' A little bit.'
Joey:,b' How are you doing?'
Ross:,b' Okay. Okay. I mean I\x92ll be okay. It\x92s just I don\x92t think I\nhandled it very well.'
Joey:,"b' Well, what did you say to her?'"
Ross:,b' Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.\nAnd then when I turned around she was gone.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh Ross.'
Ross:,"b' But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%\neffective.'"
Joey:,b' (shocked) What?'
Ross:,b' I gotta go find her.'
Joey:,b' Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they\ndon\x92t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!'
Ross:,b' Evidently they do.'
Joey:,b' What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)'
Chandler:,b' Oh you\x92ve got to be kidding me.'
Chandler:,b' We\x92re you just ten seconds later!'
Chandler:,b' (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.'
Joey:,"b' Hey Monica it\x92s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin\x92\nfrom your apartment.'"
Chandler:,b' What else is new?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah and we\x92d go check it out, but you took away our keys.'"
Joey:,b' How? I guess I could break down your door.'
Joey:,b' And-and you won\x92t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs\nup.)'
Joey:,"b' Uh, okay I\x92ll-I\x92ll-I\x92ll break it down. (He hands the phone\nto Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh hey hi, he\x92s doing it. He\x92s breaking down the door. (The\nchair breaks in half.) Okay, we\x92re in. (She hangs up the phone.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at '"
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' (shocked) Hi!'
Ross:,b' Uh we-we need to talk.'
Rachel:,"b' Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I\x92ve kinda got an el fresco situation\ngoing on over here.'"
Ross:,"b' Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay Ross that\x92s fine, but can you please stand near my head?'"
Ross:,b' What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I\x92m sorry. I mean I-I\nthink I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards\nRachel\x92s feet) really\x97I should have been thinking about you Rach\x85'
Rachel:,b' Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!'
Ross:,"b' Right! Right! I just\x97I want you to know that I\x92m going to be\nthere through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor\x92s appointments, the uh, the\nLamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment\x97Although we could probably worry about\nthat \x91til after we get married.'"
Rachel:,b' What married?'
Ross:,"b' Well yeah, I think we should get married.'"
Rachel:,"b' What, because that\x92s your answer to everything?'"
Ross:,"b' No, because that\x92s the right thing to do.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, maybe if you\x92re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are\nwe?'"
Ross:,b' No but\x85but still you can\x92t possibly do this alone.'
Rachel:,b' Excuse me?'
Ross:,"b' Come on Rach, you can\x92t even eat alone in a restaurant.'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m just saying if you can\x92t eat by yourself, how do you expect\nto have a baby by yourself?'"
Rachel:,b' I can too eat by myself!'
Ross:,b' When have you ever?'
Rachel:,b' When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!'
Ross:,b' Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh please, you inhale your food!'"
Ross:,b' I grew up with Monica! If you didn\x92t eat fast you didn\x92t eat!!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.'"
Ross:,"b' But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.'"
Ross:,"b' (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don\x92t know why you can\x92t\nadmit that you need me.'"
Rachel:,b' I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!'
Ross:,b' Oh my God.'
Rachel:,"b' Wow. There it is, I see it.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Thank you.'
Ross:,b' Pretty amazing huh?'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t see it!'
Ross:,b' What? What?!'
Rachel:,b' I can\x92t see it!'
Ross:,b' You-you just said that you did!'
Rachel:,"b' I know, I lied! I didn\x92t want her to think I was a terrible mother!\nI can\x92t even see my own baby!'"
Ross:,"b' Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,\n(rolls the machine closer) it\x92s-it\x92s-it\x92s, it\x92s right there (Points).'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh. Oh, it\x92s beautiful. I see it now.'"
Ross:,b' Do you really?'
Rachel:,"b' No, I don\x92t see it!'"
Ross:,"b' Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing\nthat looks like a peanut?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Sweetie that\x92s it.'
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.'"
Ross:,b' You\x92re welcome.'
Rachel:,b' Wow! I can\x92t believe that\x92s our baby.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s our baby.'"
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! So how was the doctor?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, everything went great.'"
Phoebe:,b' Good.'
Ross:,"b' Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t see the baby. Where is it?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, I know I couldn\x92t see it either at first, but it\x92s\nright umm\x85 (Starts to cry) Ross, I lost it again.'"
Ross:,b' Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.'
