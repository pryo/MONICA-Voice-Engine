Phoebe:,"b"" Monica your remote doesn't work."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh. Aw, forget it.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where\neveryone says one thing that they're thankful for."""
Joey:,"b"" Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having."""
Chandler:,"b"" That's sweet, Joey."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came\nin out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also\nthankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think """
Joey:,"b"" I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I\nmean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play\nwith your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Are you aware that you're still talking?"""
Ross:,"b"" Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my\neviction? Hmm."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."""
Ross:,"b"" I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever."""

Rachel:,"b"" Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got\ndivorced again are you?"""
Ross:,"b' Oh God, no.'"
Joey:,"b"" Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler\nbumming us out!"""
Chandler:,"b"" It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,\nmoved out, and abandoned its entire family."""
Ross:,"b"" You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings."""
Phoebe:,"b"" I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse."""
Chandler:,"b' Really? Worse than, ""More turkey Mr. Chandler?""'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's\nworse!"""
Ross:,b' In '
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."""
Joey:,"b"" Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past\nlife memories."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new."""
Rachel:,"b"" I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving."""

Phoebe:,"b"" All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think."""
Joey:,b' Sorry! Sorry.'
Chandler:,"b' Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the\ndoorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)'"
Joey:,"b' (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm over here big guy."""
Joey:,"b' (turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!\n(Starts dancing.) I scared you!'"
Chandler:,b' (laughing) You did look like an idiot.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, I wasn\'t the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember\nwhen Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"" And it came out, ""Squatternut\nbuash?""'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah that's the same."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even\nknow that happened. So which one was it?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what\nThanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."""
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey! '
Ross:,"b' Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, this is Monica.'"
Chandler:,b' (seeing her) Okay.'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving\nfood."""
Chandler:,"b"" Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."""
Ross:,"b"" So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since\nI've been away at college."""
Ross:,"b"" Well, that's cool. So did\x85 (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)"""
Ross:,"b"" Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were\nlooking for."""

Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.'"
Ross:,"b"" So I\x92m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play\nher that song we wrote last week."""
Chandler:,b' Emotional Knapsack?'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b"" Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don\x92t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're\ngonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."""

Ross:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,"b"" I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!"""
Chandler:,b' I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the\nstage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I can't believe you called her fat."""

Chandler:,"b"" We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know\nwhatever."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology\nbuilding.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh hi!'
Rachel:,"b' No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)'"
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving! '
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we\nused to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)"""

Rachel:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, '"
Rachel:,"b"" Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex."""

Rachel:,"b"" Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)\nHey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)"""
