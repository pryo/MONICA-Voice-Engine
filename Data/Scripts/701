Joey:,"b' But I-I-I can\x92t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial\naudition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I\x92m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.\n(Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?'"
Chandler:,"b' So when you said, ""Get up early,"" did you mean 1986?'"
Joey:,b' You guys don\x92t think I look 19?'

Chandler:,"b' (motioning with his hands) I\x92m not worried, I\x92m uh, I\x92m\nfascinated. Y\x92know it\x92s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school\nI uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her\nroom with her guitar.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.\n(Singing) '"
Phoebe:,"b' If you would\x92ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he\x92s\nprobably not gay.'"
Chandler:,"b' Sure, you guys don\x92t have this problem, you\x92re made of wood.\n(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!'"

Ross:,"b' Oh good, you scared me for a minute.'"
Rachel:,b' Shake it off.'
Ross:,"b' I mean\x97no, it\x92s just \x91cause, it\x92s just \x92cause you\nand I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, absolutely. Y\x92know like it was umm\x85'"

Rachel:,"b' Oh, I know. Hey, y\x92know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh\nno, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had a bonus night!'"
Ross:,b' A what?'
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, bonus night. Y\x92know, when two people break up but they\nget back together for just one night.'"
Ross:,"b' One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah-yeah, we never had that,'"
Ross:,b' No.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I\x92m-I\x92m sure it\nwould be amazing but I\x85gotta say I really-really don\x92t think it would be a good\nidea. Y\x92know? I really, really\x85don\x92t.'"
Joey:,b' \x91Sup? \x91Sup dude?'

Joey:,"b' Come on man, really how old?!'"
Chandler:,"b' Young! You\x92re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because\neverybody\x92s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!'"
Joey:,b' Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)'
Chandler:,b' Joe?'
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,"b'  Uh, you\x92ve had a lot of sex right?'"
Joey:,"b' When? Today? Some, not a lot.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, it\x92s just the reason that I\x92m asking is because I kind\nof eh, uh, I was unable to\x97I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn\x92t\x85.\nThere huh\x97hmm, there-there was an incident.'"
Joey:,"b' Don\x92t worry about that man, that happens.'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s happened to you?'
Joey:,b' Yeah! Once.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, what\x92d you do?'"
Joey:,b' I did it anyway.'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.\nCheck this out. (Gets ready to play.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Really?! Oh that\x92s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,\nif you touch my guitar again I\x92ll have to pound on you for a little bit.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (She goes to get ready.)'
Ross:,"b' Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw\x85'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh honey, but it is just about\x85'"

Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are '
Rachel:,b' Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!'
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,b' Honey I swear it we just kissed. '
Ross:,b' It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)'
Phoebe:,"b' You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting\nback together?! Can I sing at your wedding?'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay come on Phoebe, it\x92s nothing! Monica, come on!'"
Ross:,b' Look let\x92s not make a big deal out of this! It was a '
Joey:,b' Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems\nin the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the\nbest he can!!'
Chandler:,b' (angrily) I don\x92t think that\x92s what they were talking about\nJoe!!'
Phoebe:,"b' What a great night, Chandler can\x92t do it, these guys kissed\x85\n(Points to Ross and Rachel.)'"
Joey:,b' What? '
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Joey:,b' You guys kissed! Oh my\x97this is huge!'
Rachel:,b' No!'
Ross:,b' Oh no!'
Rachel:,"b' No-no, it\x92s really not huge.'"
Ross:,b' And; people thinking it\x92s huge has led Monica to believe that '
Phoebe:,"b' Well yeah, that and Chandler\x92s problem.'"
Joey:,"b' Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it\nmake you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.'"
Joey:,"b' You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, you can pass for 19.'"
Joey:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,b' Yes!'
Joey:,b' Seriously?'
Chandler:,"b' Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!'"
Joey:,b' (gasps) I\x92m 30!'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, you are not! You\x92re 31.'"
Joey:,b' (realizes) Aww crap!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so '"
Phoebe:,b' Why?!'
Rachel:,"b' Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Psss, that is whack!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (she\x92s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think\nI\x92ll play it at the wedding.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Well, I think we\x92ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I\nmean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then\nthey just take it away like-like, ""No you don\x92t.""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I don\x92t think Monica is gonna take this away.'"
Joey:,b' Wouldn\x92t she?'
Phoebe:,b' Would she?'
Joey:,b' Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You\nate my candy bar!'
Ross:,b' Guess who? (Enters fully.)'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, I just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' What do you think Monica meant when she said she didn\x92t want to\ntalk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there\nkissing.'"
Ross:,b' Still thinking about it huh?'
Rachel:,"b' Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?\n(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!'"
Ross:,"b' (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?'"
Rachel:,b' I care!'
Ross:,b' (tightening his tie) And so do I.'
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get\nchanged?'"
Ross:,b' Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)'
Rachel:,b' Am I '
Ross:,b' (sitting up) No! (Exits.)'
Chandler:,"b' Now Monica, I know you\x92re upset, but don\x92t forget. There is\ngoing to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and '"
Chandler:,b' We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).'
Chandler:,"b' Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just\nbecause it\x92s romantic, but because I can!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, don\x92t say anything, you might scare it away.'"
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s Paris, who knows we\x92re here!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I\x92m just gonna need\na small deposit.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, just some good faith money to hold the date.'"
Chandler:,"b' Pheebs, we\x92re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)'"
Joey:,"b' They break your heart, don\x92t they?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, I don\x92t really need their permission.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you\x85 You gotta do something\nabout your eyes.'"
Joey:,b' What?! What\x92s wrong with my eyes.'
Phoebe:,b' They give you away! There\x92s just-there\x92s just too much wisdom\nin there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.'
Joey:,b' And that\x92ll get rid of my wisdom?'
Phoebe:,b' Maybe just 10 minutes for you.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don\x92t care!'"
Rachel:,"b' Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn\x92t want to\ntalk to anyone, especially me?'"
Chandler:,"b' What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!'"
Rachel:,"b' No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' (To Rachel) Hey, here\x92s a thought.'"
Rachel:,"b' Monica, what are you talking about?'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Ahh, third base.'"
Rachel:,"b' Monica, y\x92know what? The only reason I did that was because your\nparty was so boring!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!! '
Phoebe:,"b' (singing, angrily) '"
Rachel:,"b' Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, Monica I don\x92t want to steal your stupid thunder!'"
Ross:,b' Got me. (He shows of his hands.)'
Rachel:,"b' All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain\x92t gonna\nhappen!'"
Rachel:,"b' I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, Rachel, I\x92ve been thinking. I don\x92t think us getting\ntogether tonight is such a good idea. I\x92m calling it off.'"
Chandler:,b' (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.'
Rachel:,"b' (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from\nyour night?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh wow. That\x97y\x92know what? That is so unfair. Y\x92know what?\nNow I '
Chandler:,"b' Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)'"
Ross:,"b' Look uh, if we\x92re gonna do this\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' We\x92re not gonna do this, all right? She\x92s just gonna think\nthat we\x92re doin\x92 it.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, I see, so everybody wins. '"
Rachel:,b' Who is it?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to\nfollow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)'"
Ross:,b' Oww!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May\nwe help you?'"
Chandler:,b' How is that ever going to happen?!'
Rachel:,"b' All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!'"
Rachel:,b' No you '
Rachel:,b' Because! Because I was sad.'
Rachel:,"b' Look, I am so\x85so happy for you guys, but you getting married just\nreminds me of the fact that I\x92m not. I\x92m not even close. And I don\x92t know,\nmaybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that\x92s dumb, but oh\nmy God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!'"
Chandler:,"b' (To Ross) I don\x92t care, she slept with me.'"
Rachel:,"b' Anyway sweetie, I am, I\x92m '"
Ross:,"b' (deadpan) Well, I\x92m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations\nman.'"
Chandler:,b' Thanks.'
Ross:,"b' (at the door) And uh, Rachel.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person\nwho\x92s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes\nwhat he said and exits disgustedly.) '"
Phoebe:,b' (singing)'
Chandler:,"b' (interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here\x92s a dollar, consider it\na deposit. Please sing at our wedding.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh thank you.'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (Goes back to bed.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Now\x85 (Starts singing again) ""'"
