Rachel:,b' Right.'
Phoebe:,"b' (entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.'"
Joey:,b' (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?'

Joey:,"b"" Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you\x92ll probably be\nhungry after the sex."""
Ross:,b' Naked friends.'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,b' Do you have any ice?'
Joey:,"b' Check the freezer. If there\x92s none in there, then we\x92re probably\nout. Are you just getting in from work? It\x92s late.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the\nmeeting with the reps from '"
Joey:,b' I discovered I\x92m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.'
Rachel:,"b' Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of '"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.'"
Rachel:,"b' But ah, you\x92re safe from it if it\x92s in the freezer?'"
Joey:,"b"" Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading """
Rachel:,b' How often do you read it?'
Joey:,b' Haven\x92t you ever read the same book over and over again?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, umm, I guess I read '"
Joey:,"b' The question should be Rach, what is '"

Ross:,b' Oh.'
Chandler:,"b' (to Robert) So ah, isn\x92t a bit cold out for shorts?'"
Chandler:,"b' Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.'"

Ross:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,b' The man is showing brain.'
Ross:,"b' Are you sure? (Chandler nods: Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch)\nI\x92m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....'"
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,"b' No, no, that won\x92t be ah, that won\x92t be necessary (leans down\nand looks up Robert\x92s shorts, seeing Robert\x92s package.) '"
Chandler:,b' (to Ross) Wellll?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, yeah, yeah!'"
Chandler:,b' What do we do? What do we do?'
Ross:,"b' Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.'"
Chandler:,b' Like an eclipse.'
Joey:,b' These little women. Wow!'
Chandler:,"b' Your liking it, huh?'"
Joey:,b' Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo\x92s manuscript. I don\x92t see how he\ncould ever forgive her.'
Ross:,"b' Umm, Jo\x92s a girl, it\x92s short for Josephine.'"
Joey:,b' But Jo\x92s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean\nit\x92s like a girl-girl thing? \x91Cause that is the one thing missing from '
Chandler:,"b' No, actually Laurie\x92s a boy.'"
Joey:,b' No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' Hey! How\x92d the ah, basketball go?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a\ntwenty-three pointer.'"
Chandler:,b' You mean a three pointer?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I get more because I\x92m dainty.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?'"
Joey:,"b' (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his\nside of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)\nHello!! (to Robert) Hi, I\x92m Joey, we haven\x92t met.'"
Phoebe:,"b' What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You\nnot like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!'"
Ross:,b' Calm down. There\x92s no reason to get testy.'
Phoebe:,b' You guys!! Come on!'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I\x92m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn\x92t\nas concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.'"
Phoebe:,b' What do you mean?'
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey. Ooh! Don\x92t sit down! '
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. And, first here\x92s a gift.'"
Chandler:,"b' Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I\nwere you I would wear them every day, every day!'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s all right, that\x92s well, I figured.... (they start to\nleave as Joey enters.)'"
Joey:,b' Hey! (starts to laugh.) How\x92s it going?'
Ross:,b' Good.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, Rach, how you doing with '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Danny just went into room 217.'"
Joey:,"b' Oooh, the next part\x92s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you\x92re gonna ruin it!'"
Joey:,b' All right I\x92ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the\nkid sees those two blanks in the hallway?'
Chandler:,"b' Hmmm, that\x92s very cool.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, all blank, and no blank, make\x92s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,\nno, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they\nget away. Aww!'"
Rachel:,b' Joey! I can\x92t believe you just did that!'
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t believe she cracked your code!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though\nshe\x92s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the\nhotel, and kills the dad.'"
Rachel:,b' Eh. Beth dies.'
Joey:,"b' Beth, Beth dies?'"
Rachel:,b' Um-hmm.'
Joey:,b' Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?'
Chandler:,"b' No, Beth doesn\x92t die, she doesn\x92t die. Does she Rachel?'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' Joey\x92s asking if you\x92ve just ruined the first book he\x92s\never loved that didn\x92t star Jack Nicholson?'
Rachel:,b' No. She doesn\x92t die.'
Joey:,b' Then why would you say that?!'
Rachel:,"b' Because, I wanted to hurt you.'"
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Oh my....'
Rachel:,b' (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I\x92m\nsorry.'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I was just thinking you\x92re day could still pick up.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Listen, Robert\x92s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just\ntell him?'"
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Please, right now, no, every time I see him it\x92s like \x91Is it\non the lose?\x92 \x91Is it watching me?\x92'"
Chandler:,"b' We can\x92t tell him, you can\x92t go up to a guy you barely know\nand talk about his.... stuff.'"
Ross:,"b' He\x92s right, even if it\x92s to say something complementary. (He\nstops and thinks about what he just said.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, I can spot you from here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, listen Robert...'"
Ross:,"b' (to Chandler) Hey, don\x92t we have to...'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, we got, um-hmm.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, I think you\x92re really, really great...'"
Phoebe:,"b' I-I-I-I-I don\x92t know, I don\x92t know what to say.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Beth is really, really sick.'"
Rachel:,b' Awwww.'
Joey:,"b' Jo\x92s there, but I don\x92t think there\x92s anything she could\ndo.'"
Rachel:,b' Joey?'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Do you want to put the book in the freezer?'
Joey:,b' (nodding his head) Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
