Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh Willie\x92s still alive!'
Chandler:,b' What are you guys doing?'
Chandler:,"b' Oooh, I\x92m afraid that does not exist.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who\x92s\ngoing like this\x85 (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth,\nthis shall be known as The Face.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! That\x92s the creep that you\x92re with at the '
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know what it is, I just can\x92t take a good picture.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m not in that.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, why don\x92t you guys go get portraits done by a professional\nphotographer.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah that\x92s great! Next to that, Chandler won\x92t look so\nstupid.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, but I should warn you, I\x92m not going. I\x92m going.\n(Does The Face while saying that last part.)'"
Ross:,"b' (To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh\x85'"
Chandler:,b' How about those three-pointers?'
Ross:,b' Amazing!'
Chandler:,b' And those guys were '
Rachel:,"b' Hey look-look, Phoebe\x92s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy? We call him Hums While He\nPees.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, I thought that guy was married.'"
Phoebe:,b' He is! But he\x92s getting divorced\x97Ross! Maybe you know him.'
Ross:,b' It\x92s not a club.'
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, if this guy\x92s going through a divorce, is it such a good\nidea to start going out with him?'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, divorced men are not bad men!'"
Chandler:,b' They have that on the napkins at the club.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I gotta get back to work.'"
Phoebe:,b' You don\x92t have to be back for a half-hour!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh!\nI could just spread him on a cracker.'"
Chandler:,"b' Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean\ny\x92know you can\x92t date him right?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend\nso much time together he should call me his work wife.'"
Ross:,"b' Soon he\x92ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.'"
Rachel:,"b' I am not gonna get fired, because I\x92m not gonna act on it.'"
Phoebe:,b' So you wouldn\x92t mind if he was dating someone else?'
Rachel:,b' Why? Is he? He is! Isn\x92t he? He\x92s dating that slut in\nmarketing!'
Ross:,b' Maybe I should open a divorced men\x92s club.'
Chandler:,b' Dude that is so sad.'
Ross:,b' I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.'
Chandler:,b' Could I play?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, well drop and give me ten more!'"
Rachel:,"b' Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?'"
Rachel:,"b' (startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what\x92s up? I\x92m just uh, about\nto umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y\x92know, like\ndried fruit and granola and stuff. What\x92s up? (She has put on the backpack.)'"
Rachel:,b' No. Why?'
Rachel:,b' Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain\x92t a locker room, okay?\nBut, y\x92know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah. All right, back to work.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah Melissa, I don\x92t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but\nI will call your supervisor.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. (Does The Face.)'
Chandler:,"b' No, I am.'"
Chandler:,"b' I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay. (You\x92ll have to see it, I can\x92t describe the face he\nmakes, but it isn\x92t good.)'"
Rachel:,b' Hi Joey! What are you doing here?'
Joey:,"b' Uhh, well I\x92ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce\nall over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got\nan extra one?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, sure. Umm\x85here. (Hands him one.)'"
Joey:,b' Great. (He doesn\x92t like it.) You got anything that\x92s not '
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I don\x92t think so Joe.'"
Joey:,"b' All right, I guess this will be fine.'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?'"
Joey:,"b' Nothing, why?'"
Rachel:,b' How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I\x92ll pay.'
Joey:,"b' Huh, Rach I got to say it\x92s gonna take a lot of money for me to go\nout on a date with a dude.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m not asking you to go on a '
Joey:,b' Really? \x91Cause I could kinda use the money.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, just-just he-he\x92s new in town and I know he doesn\x92t have\nany guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I\x92ll really\nappreciate it.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, okay.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) Ooh\x97Hey, donuts!'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all\nover himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)'"
Chandler:,b' Aww! (Smiles.)'
Ross:,"b' I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, ""I love you and\nthat\x92s why I have to kill you.""'"
Chandler:,b' Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m having a really good time!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh. No that\x92s okay, he\x92s a friend.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I\x85 Well y\x92know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so\nI\x92d just be lost.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, don\x92t freak out. I\x92ll go.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, umm that\x92s Whitney (Points), Kyle\x92s ex-wife out there,\nnow do you think that you can y\x92know divert her so that we can slip out?'"
Ross:,b' What?! No!'
Phoebe:,b' Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She\nholds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)'
Ross:,"b' Look, I don\x92t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, I\x92ll do it.\nBut just because you\x92re a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Hi Ginger.'
Ross:,b' All right! I want my key back!'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t have it!'
Ross:,b' It\x92s right there! (Points to her hand.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)'"
Ross:,"b' Look, I\x92m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though, for diverting\nKyle\x92s ex. '"
Ross:,b' Oh yeah\x97No\x97You\x92re welcome. We\x92ll talk about it later.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Hi Whitney.'
Ross:,b' Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Ross) Kyle\x92s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date\nher!'"
Ross:,"b' (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I\x92m sorry, but can you give me a\nsecond while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night?'"
Ross:,b' Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I '
Phoebe:,b' Watching ballroom dancing?'
Ross:,b' Yes! That\x92s where we realized we were both super cool people!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some '"
Ross:,b' Like what?'
Phoebe:,"b' Like she\x92s really mean, and she\x92s over critical,\nand-and\x97No! She will paint a room a '"
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' And! She uses sex as a weapon!'
Ross:,b' Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I\x92ll be on full alert\nfor room painting and sex weapons.'
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re still gonna go out with her?!'
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, didn\x92t you just hear what I said?!'"
Ross:,"b' Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her\nex-husband\x92s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you\x92ll excuse me\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' (interrupting him) No listen to me! She is '
Phoebe:,b' You see? Nothing is good enough for her!'
Rachel:,"b' Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh that\x92s nice.'
Rachel:,b' Wo-women? You mean like old women?'
Rachel:,b' (Pause) Oh.'
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s great! Wow man, so Joey must\x92ve really taught you some\nstuff huh?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' See? That\x92s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a\ncamera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) You\x92re changing it!'"
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t help it!'
Joey:,"b' All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when\nI take resume shots?'"
Chandler:,b' Borrow money from me?'
Joey:,"b' Okay, first\x97first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I\nlook down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and\nsmiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), you\x92re looking\ndown, keep looking down\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Why is there jelly on your shoe?'
Joey:,b' I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hi!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! That guy\x92s alright!'
Rachel:,b' Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.'
Joey:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, all the women.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey well, you can\x92t teach someone to be good with women. Y\x92know,\nthat\x92s why I never had any luck with Chandler.'"
Chandler:,b' (Pause) I\x92m right here!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay,\njust the idea of you and he and all these women, it\x92s just\x97And I know he\x92s\nmy assistant and I can\x92t date him\x97but it just bothers me, all right?!'"
Joey:,"b' Hey! No-no-no-no, you can\x92t take him away from me! I got a great\npartner to pick up girls with! Finally!!'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m still right here!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and\nunsatisfying this dating tons of women thing is!'"
Joey:,b' (shocked) What?!'
Rachel:,"b' I just don\x92t want him to meet anybody until I am over my\ncrush\x97And I will get over it. It\x92s-it\x92s not like I love him, it\x92s just\nphysical! But\x97I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush\non you when I first met ya!'"
Joey:,"b' I know, Monica told me.'"
Chandler:,"b' Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)'
Chandler:,b' Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their\nattention.)'
Rachel:,"b' (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know Rach.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, come on! I\x92ll give you ten free '"
Joey:,b' One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You can\x92t take that back!'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know. You uh, you got something for me?'"
Joey:,b' Ten. Okay. Now Tag there\x92s such a thing as too many women.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, for you!'"
Chandler:,b' There I am!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an\nantihistamine.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to\nBrooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know, but don\x92t worry, don\x92t worry, because I\nknow how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look\ndown, look down\x85 (He falls asleep.)'"
Chandler:,b' (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)'
Phoebe:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?'"
Ross:,"b' Listen, you are hearing '"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah well, maybe she should\x92ve spent a little less time decorating\nand a little more time in the bedroom.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, I don\x92t think '"
Phoebe:,b' You think he\x92s emotionally unavailable?'
Ross:,b' I think he can be.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, maybe he wouldn\x92t be if she didn\x92t bring the office home\nevery night!'"
Ross:,"b' Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year\x92s Eve\n1997.'"
Ross:,b' (angrily) I '
Phoebe:,b' (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!'
Ross:,b' So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)\nI\x92m sorry you had to see that.'
Rachel:,"b' Hi! (He hands her her mail) Thanks, hey so uh what\x92d you do last\nnight?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah? Another night of bird-dogging the chickas?'
Rachel:,b' Wow! I did not see that coming.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying\nI am happier when uh, y\x92know?'"
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Rachel:,b' Sp-spoil?'
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I-I\x92m startin\x92 too.'"
Rachel:,b' Yes! Hell yes!'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' I\x92d love to!'
Rachel:,"b' (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it)\nHello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and\nshe closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!'"
Ross:,b' My God!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish\nin bed, how\x92s Whitney?'"
Ross:,b' Well maybe she wouldn\x92t have to be selfish in bed if someone else\nknew where everything was!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.'
Phoebe:,b' Both of you together?'
Ross:,b' Wh-what\x92s up?'
Ross:,b' Oh just say it Kyle!'
Phoebe:,b' What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh right, because you\x92re so capable of change.'"
Ross:,"b' (To Whitney) Y\x92know, he hums when he pees!'"
Ross:,"b' It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s all right, we-we don\x92t need you. In fact, hey I\x92m\nover it already.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, and y\x92know what? I don\x92t give a tiny rat\x92s ass.'"
Ross:,"b' (To Phoebe) I\x92m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about\nher. Y\x92know, she '"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh. Y\x92know, he hums while he does other stuff to.'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, we're better off without them."""
Phoebe:,"b' And y\x92know, even if they break up again, you\x92d better not let\nhim in your sad men\x92s club!'"
Ross:,b' Divorced men\x92s club.'
Phoebe:,"b' Potato, Potaato. (She\x92s pronounces potato with the both the short\nand long As.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, let\x92s see it!'"
Chandler:,b' Ahhh.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, that looks good.'"
Phoebe:,b' You guys make a '
Joey:,"b' Yeah, we look great together.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know, we don\x92t have to imagine.'"

Joey:,b' We\x92ll just see.'
