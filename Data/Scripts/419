Ross:,b' Yeah!! Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' Easy tiger.'
Ross:,"b' I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the\nairport, it\x92s-it\x92s so great. But at the same time I\x92m thinking, ""Well,\nI\x92m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.""'"
Chandler:,b' So what are you going to do?'
Ross:,"b' Nothing! There\x92s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.\nI mean, she-she\x92d have to uh, move here. She '"

Ross:,b' I could ask her to live with me!'
Chandler:,b' Are you serious?'
Ross:,"b' I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!'"
Chandler:,"b' Because you\x92ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I\x92ve got\na carton of milk in my fridge I\x92ve had a longer relationship with!'"
Ross:,"b' Look guys, when I\x92m with her it\x92s-it\x92s-it\x92s like she\nbrings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y\x92know?'"
Chandler:,"b' And I love the milk! But, I\x92m not gonna some British girl to move\nin with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.'"
Joey:,"b' All right look, Ross, he\x92s right. Emily\x92s great, she\x92s\ngreat! But this way too soon, you\x92re only gonna scare her!'"
Ross:,b' I don\x92t want to do that.'

Chandler:,"b' Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we\ncan\x92t leave in the small apartment after we\x92ve lived here! Didn\x92t you ever\nread '"
Joey:,b' Yes! Didn\x92t you ever read '
Chandler:,"b' Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot\nmore than just season seats.'"
Joey:,b' It\x92s the Knicks!'
Chandler:,b' Screw the Knicks!'
Joey:,b' Whoa!'
Chandler:,b' I didn\x92t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so\nmuch more.'
Joey:,b' Huh.'
Chandler:,b' And the Knicks rule all.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, the Knicks rule all!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?'"
Chandler:,"b' No. No. We\x92re not gonna do that, y\x92know why? Because its not\nan even trade.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the\ntickets?'"
Joey:,b' Done!'
Rachel:,b' Let me finish. '
Joey:,b' Oh. '
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m talking about a bet, winner takes all.'"
Joey:,"b' Ooh, we could end up with nothing.'"
Phoebe:,b' Or you could end up with everything.'
Joey:,"b' Ooh, I like that.'"
Chandler:,b' No!'
Chandler:,"b' Op, op, I\x92m convinced!'"
Joey:,"b' Come on man, you know I\x92d do it for you! Because, you\x92re my best\nfriend.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, but you can\x92t use that again for a whole year.\nI\x92m in.'"
Joey:,b' All right!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?'"

Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh\x97oh, I have a game!'"
Joey:,b' Okay! '

Phoebe:,"b' Oh, well, it doesn\x92t have a name\x97oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it\ndoesn\x92t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?'"
Phoebe:,b' Good! Good! Five points!'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, Joey, same question.'"
Joey:,"b' Uhh, they\x92re tall.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,\nleafy.'"
Rachel:,b' What? Shut up! We\x92re winning!'
Chandler:,"b' Fine, let\x92s do it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I have cards!'"

Joey:,"b' Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,\nbut they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment\nback!'"
Chandler:,b' No they didn\x92t!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' (laughs) Move in with me.'
Ross:,"b' Don\x92t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say\nit\x92s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.'"
Ross:,b' I know.'
Ross:,"b' Well, so, you-you\x92ll get a job here! I mean, I\x92m always hearing\nabout uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!'"
Ross:,"b' No, I can\x92t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I\ncan\x92t leave him. Isn\x92t\x97you don\x92t think there\x92s any way?'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b' No, no, don\x92t. Why don\x92t we?'"
Ross:,b' Get married.'
Ross:,"b' No! No! I\x92m not! It\x92s-it\x92s-it\x92s perfect! I mean\nit\x92s better than you just-just moving here, \x91cause it\x92s us together\nforever, and that\x92s-that\x92s what I want.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who\x92s-who\x92s to say? Does that me\nwe-we can\x92t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married\nand I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.\nCome on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I\nmean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn\x92t it?'"
Ross:,b' Is that\x97are you saying yes? Is that yes?'

Ross:,"b' Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you\nmarry me?'"
Ross:,b' Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!'
Chandler:,b' Those were like the best seats ever.'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y\x92know, kinda\nlike a peace offering.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, that\x92s very nice. Plus, y\x92know they were free and\nthey\x92re too small.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head\ncut off.)'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)\n(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!'"
Chandler:,b' I KNOW!!!'
Chandler:,b' Open up! Open up! Open up!'
Chandler:,b' What the hell is going on?!'
Rachel:,b' We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)\n(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don\x92t feel good about it.'"
Chandler:,"b' We are switching back, right now!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, you\x92re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have\njobs, and as soon as you do, we\x92re switching it back! There\x92s nothing you can do\nto stop us! Right, Joe?'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know.'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t want to move again! '
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t care, this is our apartment! And they stole\x97you\nstole it\x97our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am\ngetting it back right now. I\x92m getting back right now!'"
Rachel:,"b' All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup\noffer.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can\x92t offer anything to us!'"
Rachel:,b' Let us keep the apartment and\x85'
Chandler:,b' Totally worth it!'

Chandler:,b' Good night.'
Joey:,b' Good night.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our\napartment back?'
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s so funny to think if you\x92d just done that right after\nthe last contest, no one would have had to move at all.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, scarf\x92s done. (It\x92s not really a scarf, it\x92s just a\nbunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with\nthem Joey and Chandler.)'"
Ross:,b' Come on! Come on. Come on.'
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'

Ross:,"b' We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.'"
Ross:,"b' (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for\nRachel\x92s reaction.) I think it\x92s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I\x92m so happy for\nyou!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, well, that\x92s great!'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Yeah. (They hug again.)'

Joey:,b' (happily) Okay!'
