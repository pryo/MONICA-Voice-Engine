Chandler:,"b"" I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."""
Ross:,"b"" Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.\nBelieve me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak\x85out. Oh my God,\nshe's going to sit on you."""
Chandler:,"b"" No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right\nnow. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh."""

Chandler:,"b"" We should start with the big stuff. Y\x92know? That'll be the\neasiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got\nit. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)"""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah that-that, doesn't look right."""
Chandler:,"b"" What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the\ncarpet.

Ross:,"b"" Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of\nthe carpet."""
Chandler:,"b"" OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."""
Ross:,"b"" Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the\nseating area."""

Ross:,"b' Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we\nwent to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not\nstop talking about the Irish potato famine?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well what about you? You weren\'t you know, so hot in college either.\nAfter everything he said, he\'d go ""ba dum bum chessh"" '"

Rachel:,"b"" Because they're people."""
Phoebe:,"b"" But people that you don't know and will never see again."""
Rachel:,"b"" Yes, but still. They're people\x85with eyes."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no,\nokay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay.\nYou're uptight."""
Rachel:,"b' I-I am not uptight\x97Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,\nman.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me.\nI'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's\nfun.

Ross:,b' Bye! (Runs out)'
Chandler:,"b"" No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room\ngot so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)"""
Chandler:,"b"" Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I\nwanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved\neverything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very\nsorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."""
