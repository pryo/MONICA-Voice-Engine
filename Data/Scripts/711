Chandler:,b' Ohh. Mmm.'
Rachel:,b' (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, y\x92know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I\x97(Chandler\nputs a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)\x97Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,\nthis is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to\nlook at the label on the box.)"""
Chandler:,b' (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent\nit to us.'
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.\nBraverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I\x97no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't\nreturn a box after you've opened the box."""
Rachel:,"b' Why, why not?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Because it's too delicious."""
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.'"
Chandler:,"b' No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send\naway for a free one and that way we '"
Rachel:,"b' (taking a bite) Oh, I\x92m sorry, what?'"
Joey:,"b' All right, I should get going, big day at work. Y\x92know I\x92m in a\ncoma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I\x92m not brain dead.'"
Chandler:,b' So\x85'
Joey:,"b' Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it\x92s just my character that\x92s\nnot brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?'"
Phoebe:,b' Absolutely!'
Joey:,b' I\x92ll see you at 8:00.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (Joey exits.) '
Chandler:,"b' Oh, what\x92s at 8:00?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to\ndiscuss the rest of you guys.'"
Ross:,"b' Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?'"
Phoebe:,b' Duly noted.'
Ross:,"b' Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,\ndo you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?'"
Ross:,"b"" Cousin Frannie\x92s wedding, it's tomorrow night."""
Ross:,b' No.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie\x92s made some new friends.'"
Ross:,"b' Well l-look okay, it\x92s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt\nSheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, she tried to undress me too.'"
Chandler:,b' I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then\nshushes\nhim.)'
Phoebe:,b' Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!'
Rachel:,"b' Umm, I think he\x92s still out. What\x92s wrong?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I\x92ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey\ntonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (reading the note) ""Pheebs, can\x92t make it, got a date. Talk to\nyou later. Big Daddy."" (Laughs) Big Daddy?'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh that\x92s a nickname we were trying out.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica\nshakes her head in disgust.)'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Here\x92s Joseph Francis!'
Joey:,b' Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!'
Phoebe:,b' So what?! That doesn\x92t give you the right to ditch me!'
Joey:,"b' Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for\nsex!'"
Ross:,"b' Phoebe he\x92s right, that is the rule.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I don\x92t accept this rule. When we make plans, I expect you to show\nup. Okay, I can\x92t just be a way to kill time \x91til you meet someone better!\nY\x92know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their\nfriendship) is for life!'"
Joey:,b' Wow! I\x92m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, it does.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I\x92m sorry. (They hug.) How\nabout uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I\x92ll pay for myself!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, you wore me down.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey Joe, while you\x92re over there how about another beer for the\nRoss-A-Tron?'"
Joey:,b' The Ross\x97Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Chandler:,b' Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!'
Rachel:,"b' So just bring it back downstairs, what\x92s the problem?'"
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t seem to say goodbye.'
Rachel:,"b' Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and\nyou want more?'"
Chandler:,b' Well I\x92ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!'
Rachel:,"b' It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham\ncracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling\x85 (Pause) Wow! My\nwhole mouth just filled with saliva! '"
Chandler:,b' (closing the box) Y\x92know what? Forget it! '
Rachel:,b' Yeah and we\x92ll drop it off downstairs so that we\x92re not\ntempted.'
Chandler:,b' Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?'
Rachel:,"b' Momma\x92s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the\ncheesecake.)'"
Joey:,b' Awww! Mel Torme died.'
Joey:,b' Aw! Does that mean the '
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it '
Ross:,"b' Well yeah, but she doesn\x92t know that. I mean, the last time she saw\nyou-you would\x92ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. '"
Ross:,"b' Oh what\x92s the big deal?! I wasn\x92t even invited to the ceremony,\njust the reception. And-and y\x92know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I\nwill just make an appearance and then, and then we\x92ll-we\x92ll leave early as a\nsign of protest.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She\x92s an assistant professor in the\nLinguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, '"
Joey:,"b' Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross\x92s behalf. I-I think\nthe rule applies here y\x92know, since she has a chance to get on broad back\x85'"
Ross:,b' (interrupting) '
Ross:,b' What? I can\x92t cancel on Joan!'
Ross:,"b' Bec\x97Did you not hear me?! She\x92s an assistant professor in the\nLinguistics department, okay? They\x92re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, all right, I\x92ll take you. I\x92ll go call Joan. (Does so.)'"
Joey:,"b' Aww that\x92s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding,\nhappiest day of her life.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, thank you for lunch.'"
Rachel:,"b' What? Wait a minute, I didn\x92t pay, I thought you paid!'"
Chandler:,b' So apparently we just don\x92t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs\nthen Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?'
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman\nis still lying in front of her door.)'
Chandler:,b' Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)'
Rachel:,b' She could be out of town. Maybe she\x92ll be gone for months.'
Chandler:,"b' By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don\x92t want her to\ncome back to bad cheesecake.'"
Rachel:,b' No that could kill her.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, we don\x92t want that.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, so we\x92re protecting her.'"
Chandler:,b' But we should take it.'
Rachel:,b' But we should move quick.'
Chandler:,b' Why?'
Rachel:,b' Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.'
Chandler:,b' Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake\nand they take off upstairs.)'
Phoebe:,b' (gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That\x92s David!'
Phoebe:,"b' David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went\nto Russia and broke my heart David!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, you say someone\x92s name enough, they turn around.'"
Phoebe:,b' David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren\x92t\nyou supposed to be in Russia?'
Phoebe:,b' Well\x85 Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, of course I would want to see you. I\x85I think about you all\nthe time.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really?'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' (excited) Yes! Oh no! '
Phoebe:,"b' I can\x92t. I can\x92t believe I have plans, I can\x92t. Can you\ndo it tomorrow night though?'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No he won\x92t. And that\x92s not even the point! Monica, I made a\nwhole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y\x92know what? Just\nbecause, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I\nshould change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don\x92t have my\nprinciples, I don\x92t have anything!'"
Phoebe:,b' Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!'
Rachel:,b' (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I\x92ll regret\nit.'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' (seeing what they\x92re doing) What do you got there?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh it\x92s umm, it\x92s tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a\ndisgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)'"
Chandler:,b' What are you doing tonight?'
Joey:,b' Huh? Uh\x85 (He starts taking off his pants.)'
Chandler:,b' Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)'
Joey:,"b' Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, I\x92ve got those plans with\nPhoebe, why?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.'"
Joey:,b' What?! Tonight?!'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s what Monica said.'
Joey:,b' After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy\non the same night she has plans with me? I think she\x92s trying to pull a fast one on\nBig Daddy!'
Ross:,"b' Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.'"
Ross:,"b' (To Monica) Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water\x92s\nfine.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. '
Joey:,"b' Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin\x92 here?'"
Joey:,"b' Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh Joey, we\x92ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There\x92s\nprime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it\nto the waiter.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it\nagain. The waiter leaves.) Y\x92know what Pheebs?'"
Phoebe:,b' Huh?'
Joey:,"b' You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (checking her watch) Yeah, I\x92m very wise. I know.'"
Joey:,b' Y\x92know-y\x92know what I really want?'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Is to have a long, long talk. Y\x92know? Get Joey out on the open road\nand really open him up.'"
Joey:,b' Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.'
Phoebe:,"b' God Joey, this is taking forever!'"
Joey:,b' What\x92s the rush? What?'
Phoebe:,b' W-w\x97I just\x97it\x92s that\x97I have\x97y\x92know I\nhave-I have an appointment. And it\x92s very important.'
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa, what is it?'"
Phoebe:,b' Well\x85 It\x92s a date.'
Joey:,"b' A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you\nwouldn\x92t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Come on Joey, don\x92t make me feel badly about this.'"
Joey:,"b' No, I\x92m gonna!! That\x92s right! Yeah, you made me feel really\nguilty about goin\x92 out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to\nyou! And now Pheebs, you\x92re doing the same thing!'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x97It\x92s not the same thing! This is '
Joey:,"b' Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist\ntoo!'"
Phoebe:,b' She was?'
Joey:,"b' Well, she graduated from high school!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, whatever. Y\x92know what? I don\x92t have time to\nconvince you because he\x92s only here for four hours, and I\x92m gonna go see him!\n(Gets up and leaves.)'"
Joey:,b' Fine!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,b' Fine!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah! (She exits.)'
Joey:,"b' (to the waiter) What are you still doin\x92 here?! I told you, lobster\nravioli!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I wouldn\x92t miss this.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, you\x92re such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We\x92re\ngoing to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)'"
Chandler:,b' Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!'
Rachel:,b' (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)'
Chandler:,b' I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to\nwhistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the\ncheesecake without me?!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are\nyou gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are\ndessert stealers! We are living outside the law!'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know what? I don\x92t trust you with this cake anymore! And I\ngot it first, and I\x92m takin\x92 it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his\napartment.)'"
Rachel:,b' What?! What?!'
Chandler:,b' Oh yes! '
Rachel:,b' Wait a minute!'
Chandler:,b' Oh yes!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don\x92t!'"
Chandler:,b' Oh yes! Oh yes!'
Rachel:,b' You think I trust you with it?! No! We\x92re gonna split it! You take\nhalf and I take half!'
Chandler:,"b' Well that\x92s not fair, you\x92ve already had some!'"
Rachel:,"b' What? Oh, well then y\x92know what? I think Monica would be very\ninterested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.'"
Chandler:,b' What do we '
Rachel:,"b' Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.'"
Chandler:,"b' (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh\x85\nThere\x92s more crust on this side. Y\x92know? So, maybe if I measured\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Oh for God sake just pick a piece!'
Chandler:,"b' All right, I\x92ll pick that one. (Points.)'"
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay,\nthere you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and\ndon\x92t come crying to me if '"
Chandler:,b' (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don\x92t come\ncrying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the\nhallway and eat my\x85 (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor.\nThat process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little\nbit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.) '"
Ross:,"b' Oh, hey Aunt Millie.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, yes it is. It\x92s uh\x85 (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to\ngrab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a\nnapkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!'"
Ross:,"b' Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn\x92t bring you here so\nyou can ambush her.'"
Ross:,b' That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on\nFrannie\x92s shoulder.)'
Ross:,"b' (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.'"
Ross:,b' So it\x92s really a question of '
Phoebe:,b' Are you sure? I\x92ll bet there\x92s another flight to Minsk in\nlike\x85'
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s really beautiful. What does it mean?'
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.'"
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re right! You\x92re right. Don\x92t say it. '
Phoebe:,b' I do too. (They kiss.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (seeing him) Okay, now\x92s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell\nat me tomorrow.'"
Joey:,"b' No! No! No Pheebs, I\x92m not gonna yell at you. I just y\x92know,\nstarted thinking about you and David and I\x85remember how bummed you were the first\ntime he left. And I just\x85 Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?'"
Phoebe:,b' No I\x92m not okay. The only guy I\x92ve ever been crazy about has\ngone to Minsk and I may never\x85I may never see him again. (Crying.)'
Joey:,"b' Hey, y\x92know you could always visit him.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh right, like they\x92re gonna let me have a passport.'"
Joey:,b' Anything I can do? Whatever you need.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well\x97But\x97Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of\nsub-atomic particles y\x92know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)'"
Joey:,b' I can give it a shot.'
Rachel:,b' Oh! Yay! Look! There\x92s a piece that doesn\x92t have floor on it!'
Chandler:,b' Stick to your side!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, come on now!'"
Joey:,"b' (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin\x92? (Starts digging\nin.)'"
Ross:,"b' What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt\nMillie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her\nattention.)'"
Ross:,b' Well\x85'
Ross:,"b' Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica\x92s wrap and\nwalks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)'"
