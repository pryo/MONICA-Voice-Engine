Chandler:, Hey
Joey:, Hey. So where's Mon?
Chandler:," Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday 
  party tonight."
Joey:, And you're not helping?
Chandler:," I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" 
  in a helium voice - not helping."
Ross:, Hey you guys!
Joey and Chandler:, (start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...
Rachel:," Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
Ross:," Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly 
  (points to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey."
Joey and Chandler:, Hi.
Ross:," Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
Joey:," You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
Rachel:," Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
Rachel:," OK, thank you."
Joey:," Yeah, you too."
Rachel:," Oh, wow, Molly is just great!"
Ross:, Yeah.
Chandler:," Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
Rachel:, What? You really think she's hot?
Chandler:," Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me 
  right now."
Rachel:, And Joey?
Joey:, How do you think she's doing?
Rachel:, Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Ross:," Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
Rachel:, Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
Chandler:, Now that Rachel's gone?
Rachel:," So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler 
  clap their hands)"
Phoebe:," Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
Phoebe:," No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". 
  Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle."
Phoebe:, What?
Phoebe:," (relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
Phoebe:," Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who 
  I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on 
  the plate of cookies."
Phoebe:, What are those?
Phoebe:," OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
Phoebe:," So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat 
  his crackers. (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)"
Rachel:, Hello.
Rachel:," Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma 
  yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology."
Rachel:," Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous 
  and arrogant and obnoxious ..."
Rachel:," No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean 
  anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged 
  you."
Rachel:," Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, 
  I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, 
  obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 
  'till it's finished."
Rachel:," I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her 
  out!"
Rachel:," Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
Rachel:," Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at 
  my ass"". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just 
  think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your 
  subordinate."
Rachel:," That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know 
  that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had 
  a deap meaningful relationship."
Rachel:," It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last 
  name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses."
Rachel:," Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely 
  right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name 
  was Morgan! Huh!"
Rachel:," Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?"
Joey:," Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
Joey:, Sure.
Chandler:, I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Ross:," Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there 
  in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me 
  feel like I earned it."
Chandler:, Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Ross:," Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I 
  love you - wovyou dovyou ..."
"Ross, Joey and Chandler:"," Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma."
Rachel:," (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if 
  you didn't go after her."
Joey:, Why not?
Rachel:," Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't 
  want anything to, you know, drive her away."
Joey:," So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call 
  her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds 
  about right."
Ross:," Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just 
  forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits."
Joey:," Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told 
  me I can't have it makes me want her even more!"
Ross:," What are you, a child?"
Joey:, Yes!
Ross:," Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your 
  sexual energy on someone else."
Joey:," Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)"
Phoebe:, Hey Mikey
Phoebe:, What are you doing?
Phoebe:, To kill Bob??
Phoebe:," No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna 
  capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can 
  maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
Phoebe:," I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! 
  (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob 
  had babies! Bob's a mom!"
Phoebe:," I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
Phoebe:," Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
Phoebe:, Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
Ross:, Whazzup??
Chandler:," Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
Ross:," Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you 
  just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
Chandler:, You don't trust him?
Ross:," Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier 
  and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny""."
Chandler:," Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? 
  Because I could get a job any day now."
Ross:," You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm 
  sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do 
  this for me?"
Chandler:," Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because 
  you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often 
  than not, he's going to have sex with it."
Ross:," Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on 
  trees. (pause) "
Chandler:, Picturing that tree?
Ross:," I am, yes."
Chandler:," Where you going, Joe?"
Joey:, For a walk.
Chandler:, Oh. You mind if I join you?
Joey:," Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize 
  my thoughts."
Chandler:, Your thoughts? Plural?
Joey:," Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, 
  I gotta see her!"
Chandler:," I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
Joey:," Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! 
  She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable 
  boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over 
  there?"
Chandler:," Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
Joey:," Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against 
  the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of."
Chandler:, Great novels? 
Joey:, Fine ... mediocre porn
Rachel:," Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) 
  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll 
  pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)"
Rachel:," Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you."
Rachel:," If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look 
  at a mirror?"
Rachel:," Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, 
  from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to 
  you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now."
Rachel:, Hi!
Rachel:," Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like 
  to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful 
  friend Gavin Mitchelle. "
Rachel:," Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely 
  with his mother. "
Rachel:, Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Rachel:, I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Rachel:," Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!"
Rachel:, Shh!
Rachel:," (to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, 
  he is the last person I want to see."
Rachel:," God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show 
  up, the guy hates me."
Rachel:, What?
Rachel:," Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys 
  had a bet to see if he can knock you over."
Rachel:," Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what 
  all the guys see in her?"
Joey:," Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?"
Rachel:," Yeah, sure!"
Joey:," Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, 
  see you later (runs after Molly)"
Rachel:," Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws 
  away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)"
Phoebe:," Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!"
Rachel:," Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?"
Phoebe:," I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility 
  now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're 
  a mother."
Rachel:, Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Phoebe:," No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed 
  them."
Rachel:," whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box 
  of rats?"
Phoebe:," Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone 
  can afford help. (she and Mike leave)"
Ross:, Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Chandler:," (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a 
  little occupied."
Ross:, We have to stop them before something happens!
Chandler:," (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both 
  head for the door) "
Joey:," So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting 
  is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work."
Joey:," Oh, I didn't go to college."
Joey:, Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Ross:," Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
Ross:, Thanx.
Joey:, (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Ross:," What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here 
  on my couch?"
Joey:," No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. 
  What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? 
  Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, 
  and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this 
  way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again."
Ross and Chandler:, Come on! Joe!
Joey:, Ok (admits)
Ross:," Yeah, come on in. Molly?"
Ross:," Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess 
  we have no problem."
Joey:," It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at 
  him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!"
Phoebe:," Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing 
  the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
Phoebe:," Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
Phoebe:, Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Phoebe:," No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what 
  are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then 
  each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) 
  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?"
Phoebe:," Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just 
  give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. 
  They're Bob's favorites. "
Phoebe:, You must think I'm crazy.
Phoebe:," Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. 
  I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to 
  my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't 
  told you about that yet, have I?"
Rachel:," Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?"
Rachel:," Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
Rachel:, Mmm hmm.
Rachel:, No.
Rachel:," Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed 
  up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ..."
Rachel:," Oh, you bought me a present! Why?"
Rachel:," Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens 
  the card). ""From Gavin"""
Rachel:," (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful."
Rachel:," See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you 
  give me such a hard time?"
Rachel:," Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for 
  me."
Rachel:, You do?
Rachel:," See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion 
  of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)"
Chandler:," (sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified 
  (very happy)"
Phoebe:, (walks in) Hey
Chandler:, (normal voice) Hi
Phoebe:," Listen, I think I've left something here."
Chandler:," Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is 
  yours?"
Phoebe:," (likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of 
  my rat babies."
Chandler:," Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
Phoebe:," (realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!"
