Ross:,b' I didn\x92t get the annulment.'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' We\x92re still married! Don\x92t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets\nup leaving Phoebe in shock.)'
Ross:,"b' (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh? Yeah! Sure!'
Phoebe:,"b' (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for\njust a second?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh but Phoebe, we\x92re gonna be late for the movie.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, there\x92s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.)\nGood timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.) '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, we\x92re, we\x92re actually just gonna walk \x91cause\nit\x92s right up there at the Angelica.'"

Ross:,b' I know.'
Phoebe:,b' Ross?!'
Ross:,"b' Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer\x92s office all I could hear\nwas, ""Three divorces. Three divorces!"" Look, I just don\x92t want my tombstone\nto read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Don\x92t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you\nwant it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y\x92know? Mine\x92s\ngonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, all I know is I-I can\x92t have another failed marriage!'"
Phoebe:,"b' So okay what? You\x92re gonna be married to a girl who doesn\x92t\neven know about it?!\x97Op, '"
Ross:,"b' Well, okay so, I don\x92t have it all worked out quite yet. Just\ndon\x92t say anything to Rachel, please?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only\none who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!'"
Rachel:,"b' (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey Rach!'
Rachel:,b' What was that?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?'"
Rachel:,b' I haven\x92t seen it yet!'
Phoebe:,b' Well then you\x92d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the\nroof again and off they go.)'
Rachel:,b' Noooooooo!!'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?'"
Chandler:,"b' No. When it comes to sweets, he\x92s surprisingly strict.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no, I keep trying, y\x92know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have\ntoo\x85"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""\x85go to the\nbathroom."" He may think I\x92m sick.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, so that\x92s this is gonna work now? You\x92re just gonna\norder me around all the time?'"
Chandler:,b' All right.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey Monica!'

Joey:,b' Oh my God! You\x92re pregnant!'
Chandler:,"b' No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here\x92s\nthe thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I\x92m gonna be moving\nout man.'"
Joey:,"b' Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh\x85 Hey! I\x92m really happy for you guys!\nCongratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the\nverge of tears as Monica stops him.)'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses,\nand turns back.) Like you\x92d believe that. This sucks!'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, I-I\x92m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise\nyou, the minute Monica and I break up I\x92m moving right back in with you!'"
Joey:,"b' (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you\x92re gonna be moving in\nwith him I feel it\x92s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay?\nHe\x92s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm\x85 Oh-oh he always, he\nalways umm\x97Oh, who am I kidding! He\x92s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'

Phoebe:,b' (gasps) You\x92re pregnant!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh! That\x92s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you\nname it? Hint: Phoebe.'"
Ross:,b' Hey! Hi!'

Phoebe:,"b' Guys, I\x92m happy too.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled\x85 (Winks\nat Ross.)'"
Ross:,b' Bye.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel\x85 Bad news for Rachel, what could\nthat be?!'"
Ross:,"b' Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an\nembarrassment! I should go live under somebody\x92s stairs!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ross, it\x92s not that big a deal! So you\x92ll been divorced three\ntimes, you\x92ll still have a life, you\x92ll go on dates\x85'"
Ross:,"b' (interrupting) No! No, I won\x92t! I\x92ll be at the bottom of the\ndating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,\nand-and, Geologists.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ross, you\x92re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and\nsweet and that is '"
Ross:,b' Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know that\x92s really fair. Y\x92know? Most guys who have\nbeen divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this\nembarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I\x92ll show you! Come here.'"
Ross:,b' What?! Why?'
Phoebe:,"b' (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced\nfor the third time, but wouldn\x92t you date him?'"
Ross:,"b' And if you wait right here, I\x92ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm\nand prevents him from escaping.)'"
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' (looking down) What gave me away?'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, so that\x92s it, everybody knows! It\x92s official,\nwe\x92re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?'"
Chandler:,b' Wow that was my scariest voice! You\x92re very brave.'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, the worse day! Y\x92know, you think you\x92re making progress\nat work and then your boss calls you Raquel.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me\nSha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.'"
Rachel:,"b' I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of\ncourse no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end\nof the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I-I still think you\x92re very-very nice and very pretty\x85'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! That\x92s so great! I\x92m so happy for you guys! '
Rachel:,"b' And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are\ngonna have such a good time living together!'"
Rachel:,"b' And Chandler, you\x92re gonna have to watch those long showers you\ntake in the morning because you know Raquel can\x92t be late.'"
Chandler:,b' Rach\x85'
Rachel:,b' Ohh! This is '
Ross:,"b' \x85once you know the stories, it\x92s not that bad. First marriage,\nwife\x92s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the\naltar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn\x92t allow you to get\nmarried when you\x92re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada\x92s\nfault.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn\x92t be interested? Who\nwouldn\x92t want to date him?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn\x92t you want a date?'"
Phoebe:,b' (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?'
Ross:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' (leaning to him) She said, ""He\x92s obviously still in love with\nthis Rachel girl."" (He glares at her.)'"
Ross:,"b' This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved\nher in the past, but '"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.'"
Ross:,"b' We were drunk! I would\x92ve married uh, '"
Phoebe:,b' Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! '
Ross:,"b' (to the panel) Look, I\x92m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I '"
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, and now he\x92s using this three divorces reason because he '"
Ross:,"b' (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about\nthe whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I\x92ll go to my lawyer\x92s office right now\nand get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth\x97(leans\ndown to Meg\x92s ear)\x97Nothing!!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, Joey\x92s my best friend.'"
Chandler:,b' You just said\x85 Of course you\x92re my best friend. Would you\nplease tell Rachel though?'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches\nfor one.)'
Chandler:,b' Hey-hey!'
Chandler:,b' I am now!'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey roomie!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, bye! (Exits.)'"
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Are you pregnant?!'
Rachel:,b' Um-hmm.'
Rachel:,"b' (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that\x92s funny, I can\x92t believe I did\nthat.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)'
Rachel:,b' Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.'
Rachel:,"b' Monica, where did you get these?!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, good God, they\x92re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously\nexpelled cookie matter from the tissue.)'"
Joey:,"b' God, it\x92s gonna so weird like when I come home and you\x92re not\nhere. Y\x92know? No more Joey and Chan\x92s. No more J and C\x92s. ""You wanna\ngo over to Joey and Chandler\x92s?"" ""Can\x92t, its not there.""'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, I\x92m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the\nsame stuff.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah but we won\x92t be able to like get up in the middle of the night\nand have those long talks about our feelings and the future.'
Chandler:,b' Not once did we do that.'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah? Well, how\x92d she take it?'"
Chandler:,b' And you\x92re upset because you didn\x92t make your best friend\ncry?'
Joey:,b' Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It\x92s like the end of an\nera! No more J-man and Channie\x92s!! '
Chandler:,"b' Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!'"
Ross:,b' Yes.'
Ross:,"b' Yes, second in two years. Third overall.'"
Ross:,"b' Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do '"
Ross:,b' This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.'
Ross:,b' I think just the '
Ross:,b' Easy.'
Ross:,b' No problem.'
Ross:,"b' Ooh! There\x92s no way to do this without her? \x91Cause I kinda all\nready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)\nI will think about the therapy.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Okay!'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?'
Rachel:,"b' Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!'"
Rachel:,"b' Mon, honey you\x92re not dying. I\x92m just moving out. Y\x92know,\nI mean we\x92re gonna see each other all the time.'"
Rachel:,b' Are you okay? You\x92re not blinking.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, all right. But y\x92know I gotta say, I don\x92t, I don\x92t\nthink six years counts as an era.'"
Rachel:,b' What is the matter with you?!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, fine, but don\x92t get mad at me. It\x92s-it\x92s just\na little hard to believe.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know, it\x92s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!\nY\x92know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I\nguess I\x92m not upset because I don\x92t see you guys going through with it. I\x92m\nsorry.'"

Ross:,b' Oh no.'
Phoebe:,b' So? Did you get the annulment?'
Ross:,b' I couldn\x92t.'
Phoebe:,b' I knew it! Because you love Rachel.'
Ross:,b' It\x92s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, complicated \x91cause of the love.'"
Ross:,"b' I\x85 I do, I do not love Rachel. I\x92m gonna tell her right now\nabout the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?\nWould I do that if I loved her?'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92ve never been more convinced of your love for her.'
Ross:,b' I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)'
Ross:,"b' Ohh, what\x92s wrong?!'"

Phoebe:,"b' Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy\nrich by the way. Yeah. But it won\x92t work out.'"
Joey:,b' Wow.'
Phoebe:,"b' I know. Then, I\x92m gonna marry Chandler for the money and\nyou\x92ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.'"
Joey:,b' Great!'
Phoebe:,b' But then we ditch those two and that\x92s when we get married.\nWe\x92ll have Chandler\x92s money and Rachel\x92s kids and getting custody will be\neasy because of Rachel\x92s drinking problem.'
Joey:,"b' Oh-oh, what about Ross?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I don\x92t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and\nI kill him.'"
