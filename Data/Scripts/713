Joey:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' What are you doing?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.'"
Joey:,b' (laughs) Why would you want to do that?'
Rachel:,b' So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.'
Joey:,"b' Rach, there '"
Rachel:,b' And your '
Joey:,b' No. No. No.'
Rachel:,b' No?'
Joey:,b' No. Rosita does not move.'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry, Rosita? As in\x85'"
Joey:,b' As in Rosita does not move.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, it\x92s just a chair! What\x92s the big deal?'"
Joey:,b' The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to\nthe kitchen and it\x92s at the perfect angle so you don\x92t get any glare coming off\nof Stevie.'
Rachel:,b' Stevie the TV?'
Joey:,b' (glaring at her) Is there a problem?'
Rachel:,"b' No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)\nOh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling\non the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what\x92s weird? After you guys get married, when you\nintroduce me to people you\x92re gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law\nRoss."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That\x92s\nweird isn\x92t it?'"
Chandler:,"b' Couldn\x92t I just say, ""This is Ross?""'"
Ross:,"b' (disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, it looks like mom and dad\x92s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a\nbroken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is\x85Oh my God!!'"
Phoebe:,b' What? What happened to the window in the attic?!'
Ross:,b' I can\x92t believe they-they didn\x92t even tell us!'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t believe I still don\x92t know what happened to the '
Ross:,"b' (on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!\n(Listens) Yes we\x92re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?'"
Chandler:,b' (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, Joey I am so sorry.'"
Joey:,"b' I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to\nmove your mom, and you said don\x92t, and I did it anyway and her '"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, come on\x97Joey, I\x92ll buy you a new one! All right?\nWe\x92ll go down to the store right now and we\x92ll-we\x92ll get you a new chair.'"
Joey:,b' (slowly turning and glaring at her) She\x92s not even cold yet!'
Rachel:,"b' But don\x92t you think Rosita would\x92ve wanted you to move on? I\nmean y\x92know, she did always put\x85your comfort first.'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s true.'
Rachel:,b' (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I\x85 (Shuts off the TV.) I don\x92t want Stevie to see her like\nthis.'"
Ross:,"b' I can\x92t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.\nMan, some-some stranger\x92s gonna be living in '"
Ross:,b' They kept your room for a while.'
Ross:,"b' Come on, you know they love you.'"
Ross:,b' I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It\x92s not my\nfault.'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ugh, I hate this year!'"
Ross:,b' What\x92s wrong with this year?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well okay, it\x92s already February and I\x92ve only given two\nmassages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh that\x92s right!'
Ross:,"b' Hey, y\x92know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of\nmine made good money doing telemarketing.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone\njob I had. Y\x92know, I probably wouldn\x92t have to say spank as much. (Monica and\nRoss are shocked.) '"
Ross:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, like you never called!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I '"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the\nscript.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply\nmanager please?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh okay, well I\x92m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the\nphone.) Yeah you\x92re right, this is easy.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh well, all right\x85um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?'"
Chandler:,b' Joey! Joe! (Sees that he\x92s not here and starts investigating. He\npicks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer\x92s still cold.\nSomething '
Ross:,b' Dad?'
Ross:,b' (entering with Monica) Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Dad, we-we can\x92t believe you\x92re selling the house.'"
Ross:,b' (To Monica) Let\x92s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.'"
Ross:,"b' Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-who\x92s\ncigarettes are these?'"
Ross:,"b' Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades)\nMath, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym\x85(He puts it away and finds something else.)\nOooh, my '"
Ross:,b' It\x92s a clown kit! Clown kit!'
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' How are you ever going to sell this place?'
Ross:,"b' Oh no. Dad! Dad! What\x85(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips\napart.) Oh God\x85everything\x92s ruined! Dad, she\x92s gonna be crushed!'"
Ross:,b' No!'
Phoebe:,"b' (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to\nyour supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from\nEmpire Office Supplies I\x92d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She\x92s\nreading from the script.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m hearing what you\x92re saying, but at our prices everyone\nneeds toner.'"
Phoebe:,b' May I ask why?'
Phoebe:,b' I surely do!'
Phoebe:,"b' (doesn\x92t have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you\x92re out of\ntoner?'"
Phoebe:,b' No-no wait-wait! I can\x92t just let you hang up! Just please talk to\nme.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?'"
Phoebe:,b' Chandler?'
Phoebe:,"b' No look, I-I\x92m sure that people know you exist!'"
Chandler:,"b' My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the\ndoor, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming\nup the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)'"
Rachel:,b' You will like it!'
Joey:,b' No I won\x92t.'
Rachel:,b' You don\x92t even know!'
Joey:,"b' Because, I know what I like and what I don\x92t like! It\x92s not the\nsame thing!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well look, if you don\x92t like this\x85(The audience\x92s\nlaughter at Chandler\x92s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel\x92s line.)'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know why you say that so soon.'
Rachel:,"b' Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in\nthe store! Hey, y\x92know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.'"
Joey:,b' Francette? What is she? A couch?'
Joey:,b' Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually\nmove Rosita out of here. Y\x92know, start the healing process?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I guess you\x92re right. Maybe, maybe I\x92ll take her down to\nthe incinerator. It\x92s gonna be so sad, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back,\nbut it doesn\x92t come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and\nlooks back at it.) She\x92s healed!'"
Rachel:,b' That\x92s weird.'
Joey:,"b' No it\x92s not weird, it\x92s a miracle!'"
Rachel:,b' It\x92s not a miracle Joey! I\x92m sure there\x92s some\nexplanation.'
Joey:,"b' Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous\nthings can happen!'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, I really don\x92t\x85'"
Joey:,b' (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?'
Rachel:,b' Well no.'
Joey:,b' Miracle!'
Rachel:,"b' No, y\x92know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or\nsomething!'"
Joey:,b' Someone like an\x85angel?'
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s right Joey, the chair angel came in and healed your chair.\n(She sits down in the chair.)'"
Joey:,b' (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads\nfor her room.)'
Ross:,"b' Dad, that won\x92t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and\nall hers is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her\nthink you guys love me more than you love her.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, can you blame her?'"
Ross:,"b' Dad, dad I don\x92t want to hear about it.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and\ndamnit, we\x92re gonna give her some! Okay, grab\x85grab some empty boxes. Okay?\nWe\x92ll-we\x92ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers\nwe\x92ll-we\x92ll put \x91em in there. '"
Ross:,b' Like uh y\x92know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art\nprojects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could\x92ve made this!'
Ross:,b' Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could\x92ve won this!'
Ross:,"b' Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?'"
Rachel:,b' (grabbing a beer out of the chair\x92s fridge) I am so psyched I kept\nthis chair for myself!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, how\x92s\x85how\x92s the uh, miracle chair?'"
Joey:,b' Fine.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah? Wow! Y\x92know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!'"
Joey:,b' No. Really?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV '
Joey:,b' (quietly) My chair heals itself.'
Phoebe:,"b' Earl, you\x92re not hearing me! All I\x92m saying is that\nyou\x92re not alone, alright? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her\ncoworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn\x92t mean him.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right. So Earl, let\x92s just forget about the people at the\noffice, okay? There-there\x92s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around\nfor! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh sorry, boyfriend!'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, whatever! Anything!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, he\x92s gotta go.'"
Phoebe:,b' No! I\x92m not finished yet! Don\x92t! Don\x92t you dare hang up\non me!!!'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' (overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great\nmemory.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just\ncreated for her.)'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never\nwent anywhere without-without that coloring book.'"
Ross:,b' Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t know how that got in there.'"
Ross:,"b' Umm, your boxes are umm\x85'"
Ross:,b' Dad?'
Rachel:,b' Hey Chandler!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling\nmassage, and speakers in the head rest?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92d love to but I\x92ve tried that so many times they\nwon\x92t even let me in the store anymore.'"
Rachel:,b' Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment?'
Chandler:,b' (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is\nmaking all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of\nthe Year?'
Rachel:,b' I just purchased the '
Chandler:,b' That\x92s awesome! That\x92s great! What made you do it?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, it\x92s a long story, but umm I broke Joey\x92s chair\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Whoa-whoa-whoa! '
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' I thought '
Rachel:,b' Ohhhhh. That\x92s how it got fixed!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?'"
Rachel:,b' Noo! (Laughs) Angels.'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m gettin\x92 my chair back! (Heads for Joey and\nRachel\x92s.)'
Rachel:,b' What? Wh-hey!'
Joey:,"b' Well, it looks like it wasn\x92t healed after all! Yeah! So, I guess\nthis chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)'"
Chandler:,b' Joey you broke my chair!!'
Joey:,b' '
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!'"
Joey:,"b' So, there was no miracle?!'"
Rachel:,"b' No Joe, no miracle.'"
Joey:,b' (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I\x92m so\nglad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.'
Rachel:,"b' Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don\x92t get that chair anymore! All right?\nThat is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!'"
Chandler:,b' I think I should get the chair!'
Joey:,b' How do you figure?'
Chandler:,b' Because '
Rachel:,b' No-no-no! This chair\x92s not going anywhere.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, where\x92s the logic in that?!'"
Rachel:,"b' The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to\nbreak a chair in half!'"
Chandler:,b' So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!'
Joey:,b' That\x92s right!'
Chandler:,b' What are you guys? Like a '
Joey:,b' Yeah! We are!'
Rachel:,b' We\x92re the Cobras!'
Phoebe:,b' (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He\x92s\nthe supply manager around here.'
Phoebe:,b' (goes over to his desk) Earl! I\x92m Phoebe.'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, look it, you-you can\x92t kill yourself.'"
Phoebe:,b' No-no I can\x92t! I can\x92t let you do it!'
Phoebe:,b' Because it was fate that made me call you today!'
Phoebe:,b' No! Think about it okay? '
Phoebe:,b' Yes.'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m not gonna give you tips! Look don\x92t you see that\nthis-this\x85this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, it\x92s fate!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh. Well umm, okay here\x92s a weird thing. My mother was also a\nsupply manager.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,\nright? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I\x92ve got-I\x92ve got goose bumps. (She\nholds out her arm.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, y\x92know I\x92m wearing layers and it\x92s warm.'"
Phoebe:,"b' But if\x97no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the\nuniverse does! And that says a lot!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, I don\x92t-I don\x92t think it\x92s you. This is a\nfreaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it\x92s you.'"
Ross:,b' All right. I think it was a mouse.'
Ross:,b' (even more shocked) What?!!!'
Ross:,"b' Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid\nboxes get wet and she gets a '"
Ross:,"b' Well, what about me?! I\x92m a medical marvel!!'"
Joey:,b' Oh yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Ahhhh\x85.'
Joey:,b' Ahhh\x85\x85 (To Rachel) Eh?'
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.'"
