Phoebe:,"b' Well, I left my guitar here again.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. '
Phoebe:,b' Great! Umm\x85(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)'
Phoebe:,b' So do you want to hang out or something?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh are you and Chandler\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?'
Chandler:,"b' Hey Pheebs, what\x92s up?'"
Phoebe:,b' You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! You\x92re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!'
Phoebe:,b' You told me you hate massages!'
Chandler:,"b' Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t believe this! How long as this been going on?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it has a name?'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay\x97Oop! Too late! I\x92m leaving! Come on Chandler let\x92s\ngo! (She storms out.)'
Chandler:,"b' Well, Phoebe I thought I\x92d\x97(Off Phoebe\x92s\nlook)\x97Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we\x92re\nalmost there! We\x92re almost there!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh Joey, I\x92m so happy things worked out for us that we\x92re\nhaving this baby together. I love you so much.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I love you too.'"
Rachel:,"b' And I hope it\x92s not an inappropriate time to say this but,\nyou\x92re the best sex I ever had.'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One\nmore push! One more push!'"
Ross:,b' (crying) I hope you\x92re a better father than you\x92re a friend!!\n(Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)'
Rachel:,b' (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!'
Joey:,b' What? What\x92s going on?'
Rachel:,b' Come feel this! Come feel my belly!'
Joey:,b' Aaaah\x85'
Rachel:,b' Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel\nthis?!'
Joey:,b' Really?!'
Rachel:,b' Yes!'
Joey:,"b' Oh, y\x92know what? Maybe uh, you\x85you should come to me. I\x92m a\nnot, I\x92m not wearing any bottoms.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh my, oh my God!'"
Rachel:,"b' Aw, it\x92s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she\x92s\nlike umm\x85oh\x85who\x92s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?'"
Joey:,b' Mia Hamm?'
Rachel:,b' Mia Hamm!'
Joey:,b' Oh that\x92s amazing. (Drops the sheet.)'
Rachel:,b' (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!'
Joey:,b' Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!'
Chandler:,b' Hey babe.'
Chandler:,b' Who says you can\x92t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?\nMaybe we can take it back?'
Chandler:,b' How about to the street say from the balcony?'
Chandler:,b' Okay. How about in that cabinet?'
Chandler:,b' How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the\nbathroom.)'
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and\nrelax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)\nIt\x92s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh y\x92know, I\x92ve been living here a while and I\x92ve never\nseen what\x92s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?'"
Chandler:,b' Don\x92t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!'
Chandler:,b' Fine.'
Chandler:,b' (walking casually away) Love you.'
Phoebe:,"b' (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!'"
Chandler:,"b' Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like\nthree years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,\n""If it helps!"" (Goes to the bedroom.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Why won\x92t you let me massage you?'
Phoebe:,b' Monica! We lived together for years! I\x92ve seen you naked!'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m curious about the human body.'
Phoebe:,"b' But I\x92m a professional! And I\x92m really good! Look, if\nyou\x92re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?'"
Phoebe:,b' It does! How would you feel if you couldn\x92t share your cooking?\nOr-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn\x92t teach us about dragons.'
Phoebe:,"b' Potato, potaato. '"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey Ross! The baby\x92s kicking!'
Ross:,"b' What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into\ntrouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs\nRachel\x92s belly.)'"
Rachel:,b' It\x92s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do\n(Mimics him) that again.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?'"
Rachel:,b' Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey\x92s room and he was\nsleeping\x85'
Joey:,b' A dreamless sleep.'
Ross:,"b' My God, the baby\x92s kicking. That\x92s great. Although I\x85kinda\nwish I-I would\x92ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y\x92know.'"
Joey:,b' Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.'
Ross:,"b' Look, I-I don\x92t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So\x85Here.\nHere\x92s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!\nI\x92ll be there! Okay? I don\x92t care if it\x92s three in the morning and all you\nwant is ice cream.'"
Joey:,b' Wow! Can I get a copy of that?'
Phoebe:,b' (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?'
Phoebe:,"b' (in a soothing voice) Great, let\x92s begin. (She starts the massage.)\nHow\x92s the pressure?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it\x92s not weird is it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s right, you just enjoy.'"
Phoebe:,b' (getting uncomfortable) Okay.'
Chandler:,b' I wasn\x92t trying to open your closet! I wasn\x92t trying to open\nyour closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)'
Joey:,"b' Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?'"
Chandler:,b' Monica has a secret closet and she won\x92t let me see what\x92s\nin it.'
Joey:,b' Why not?'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I\ncan\x92t see?!'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know. Ooh, I bet it\x92s Richard.'"
Chandler:,b' Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?'
Joey:,"b' Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she\x92s having her cake and\neating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!'"
Chandler:,b' And here we go\x85'
Joey:,"b' I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was\nbehind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs\ncame pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y\x92know it wouldn\x92t kill ya to\nrespect your wife\x92s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the\ndoor.) Stupid closet full of bugs!'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I\ndon\x92t\x97Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh hey whoa-whoa, don\x92t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant\nthey got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.'"
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Joey:,b' Absolutely. '
Rachel:,b' Okay. Oh God\x97Ow!\x97Oo!'
Joey:,"b' Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything\x92s gonna be\nfine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing\nbones!'"
Joey:,b' Hey! So?'
Rachel:,"b' Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you\x92ve had one of these Braxton\nthingies?'"
Joey:,b' So but everything is normal.'
Joey:,b' And-and there\x92s no danger to her and the baby?'
Rachel:,b' Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so\nnice and calm.'
Joey:,b' Calm?! I wasn\x92t calm! I\x92ve never been more scared in all my\nlife!'
Rachel:,b' But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.'
Joey:,b' Well what do I know?! I\x92m not a doctor!'
Rachel:,b' But I\x97But everything is okay. I\x92m fine!'
Joey:,b' You sure?!'
Rachel:,"b' Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor\x92s uterus\nthough. Mild discomfort, what\x92s he talking about?'"
Joey:,b' (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!'
Ross:,b' (rushes in) Is everything okay?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, everything\x92s fine!'"
Ross:,"b' Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?'"
Joey:,b' Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.'
Ross:,"b' Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don\x92t even feel them.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, no uterus, no opinion.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey uh, what\x92s with the candy?'"
Ross:,b' Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie\ntheater.'
Rachel:,b' Oh you went to the movies by yourself?'
Ross:,b' No I\x97Mona!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I gotta go back in there.'"
Ross:,b' What? Why? What\x92s wrong?'
Rachel:,"b' No, everything\x92s fine. I just gotta go back\x85'"
Ross:,"b' No really, you tell me what\x92s up.'"
Rachel:,b' I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)'
Ross:,"b' (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh hey, don\x92t worry about it man. Don\x92t worry about it, no big\ndeal.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah but still, I mean it should\x92ve been me. I\x92m the dad.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He\nbrought '"
Chandler:,b' There has '
Joey:,"b' Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I\x92m not an nine-year-old\ngirl.'"
Joey:,b' Then why do you throw like one?'
Chandler:,b' Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.'
Joey:,"b' Sure. ""Monica.""'"
Chandler:,"b' So, how\x92s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any\nday now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found\nthat quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just\x97I wish I didn\x92t feel this way\nabout Rachel anymore, y\x92know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love\nliving with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think\x85I\nthink Ross feels left out. Y\x92know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the\ndoctor thought I was the father. God\x85 You should\x92ve seen the look on Ross\x92s\nface. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I\x92m doing here. For all I know I\x92m\njust locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s a good idea.'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,\nRoss is kinda bummed huh?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I just\x85I feel terrible.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, it\x92s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to\nthe hospital? Y\x92know? You\x92re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring\nan all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the\ndoor.) Richard? If-if you\x92re in there, could you pass me my credit card?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' No-no, I got that.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Okay but you should know though, I\x92ve raised my rates to $200\nan hour.'"
Phoebe:,b' I mean $500.'
Phoebe:,b' 600.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to\nhurt you and it just spurred you on.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really? There\x92s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!\nOhh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!\n(Pause) I mean hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, you can\x92t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I\nhave, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well not clients, lovers. But let\x92s just y\x92know, try it again.\nCome back and-and we\x92ll work through it.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes.'
Phoebe:,"b' Great! Okay, if you\x92ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you\nhear something you liked?'"
Rachel:,b' Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!'
Ross:,"b' Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh! That\x92s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the\nsandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?'
Ross:,b' Well yeah!'
Rachel:,b' Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)'
Ross:,b' What?! What?! Rach what?!'
Joey:,b' What\x92s going on?'
Ross:,"b' I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.'"
Joey:,b' Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.'
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) I-I\x92m sorry Rach, I didn\x92t know. Are you gonna be\nokay?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that\nsandwich is gone when I get out there?'"
Joey:,b' I\x92m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)'
Ross:,b' I can\x92t believe this! I shouldn\x92t be the one making her throw\nup!'
Joey:,b' Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don\x92t know any of it\nand I\x92m the father. I wish I\x92d be more involved y\x92know.'"
Rachel:,"b' (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' What\x92s up?'
Joey:,"b' Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.'"
Rachel:,b' (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?'
Joey:,"b' The thing is\x85\x92cause I live with Rachel I\x92m here for a lot\nof the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross\x85Ross is missing everything. So\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,b' Maybe you two should live together.'
Rachel:,b' Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?'
Joey:,"b' Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that\x85if\nyou\x92re gonna have a roommate, y\x92know it might as well be the father.'"
Rachel:,"b' But Joey, I don\x92t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment\nand disrupt his life like that. I mean\x97(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)\x97Or\nhe does.'"
Ross:,b' No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just\ntry it like on a temporary basis.'
Rachel:,"b' But Ross, its you and me!'"
Ross:,b' So? Sure! But it-it wouldn\x92t be anything romantic. And\nI\x92m-I\x92m dating Mona\x97Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour\nago! What is wrong with me?!'
Joey:,"b' All right now, so? What do you think?'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know. Is it crazy?'
Ross:,"b' No! No it\x92s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I was due.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, let\x92s do it. I\x92ll move in.'"
Ross:,b' Really?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Oh Rach that\x92s great. That\x92s great. (They hug and Joey breathes\na sigh of relief.)'
Chandler:,"b' Not to shabby, I got this all off myself\x85using my wife\x92s\ntools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what\x92s behind the\ngreen door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!'"
Chandler:,b' (laughs) You\x92re messy.'
Chandler:,b' I married Fred Sanford!'
Chandler:,"b' No, honey you\x92re not sick! Look, I don\x92t love you because\nyou\x92re organized, I love you in spite of that.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around\ncan we, can we share the closet.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' So Rachel\x92s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?'
Joey:,"b' Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because\nRachel couldn\x92t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice\nwith calcium though. And uh, it\x92s a couple weeks past it\x92s expiration date, so\nit\x92s got a bit of a kick.'"
Chandler:,b' Are you okay?'
Joey:,"b' Are you kidding me? I\x92m great! Yeah, I\x92m uh; I\x92m better\nthan great. I am good. And now that she\x92s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff\naround here that I couldn\x92t do before. Y\x92know? Like umm, I can walk around naked\nagain. Y\x92know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this\nis good for me. Y\x92know? I like being on my own, I\x92m uh, better off this way.\nI\x92m uh, a lone wolf. Y\x92know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What\x92s a\nwolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s it. Just relax.'
Phoebe:,b' Come on more!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, you like that don\x92t you?'"
Phoebe:,b' You want it there? You take it there baby!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she\x92s\ndoing.) And now I\x92m going to cover you back up, and umm we\x92re never doing this\nagain.'"
