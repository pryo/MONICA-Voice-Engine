Chandler:,"b' (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Op, but the twelfth brings a lover\x92s spat.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.'"

Chandler:,b' Oh that\x92s right. It\x92s your first day! So are you psyched to\nfight fake crime with your robot sidekick?'

Phoebe:,"b' No! Joey, you\x92re going to be great!'"
Joey:,"b' But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don\x92t know anything\nabout technology! I can\x92t even use Chandler\x92s computer except to find porn!\nAnd-and that\x92s only \x91cause it\x92s right there when you turn it on!'"
Phoebe:,b' (in a sexy voice to Chandler) I\x92ll be waiting.'
Chandler:,b' Are you judging them by their covers? Because you\x92re really not\nsupposed to do that.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, I\x92m just deciding which one to use\x97I\x92m gonna start\nwriting another book!'"
Rachel:,b' Be-because the last one was such a big seller?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one\nwho has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. '"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'

Ross:,"b' Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help\nme out if you guys were here to make me look good.'"
Ross:,b' Thanks!'
Joey:,"b' Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?'"
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,b' Oh wow! He\x92s so lifelike! (Starts touching the guy\x92s cheeks)\nUnbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy\x92s ears.'
Joey:,"b' (slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Sorry about that\x85(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so\nwhere\x92s C.H.E.E.S.E.?'"

Joey:,"b' Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot,\ny\x92know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.'"
Joey:,"b' I\x92m sorry, it just\x97I don\x92t know it doesn\x92t really look\nlike it can do anything.'"
Ross:,b' It-it\x92s great to meet you Paul.'
Ross:,"b' Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.'"
Ross:,b' Eh-wh\x97Excuse me?'
Ross:,"b' That\x92s funny. Umm\x85. (Pause, then serious) It\x92s not funny.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one\nchance I can, I can change your mind.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' This is\x97you\x97(Ross starts laughing.)'
Ross:,"b' Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this\nbefore. I mean, I mean I\x92ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never\ndone it with a student\x97I mean I not\x97not '"
Ross:,b' And the Irish guy wins the joke!'
Chandler:,b' Ross!'
Ross:,"b' Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr.\nStevens I\x92d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.'"
Phoebe:,"b' You\x92re Elizabeth\x92s father, huh? I can see now where she gets\nher rugged handsomeness.'"
Chandler:,b' There\x92s a Mr. Bing!'
Ross:,"b' Okay umm, why don\x92t we all take a seat, y\x92know? And uh, and\nI\x92ll get us all some uh some coffees\x97(He goes to pull out Elizabeth\x92s\nchair, but Paul steps in)\x97Yeah, why don\x92t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and\nyou guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y\x92know? Whatever pops into your\nhead. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica,\nand Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)'
Chandler:,"b' But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college.\nUh, funny story\x85 (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn\x92t happy.)\nYou\x92re roommate in college died didn\x92t he?'"
Ross:,"b' (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets\ndown their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.'"

Rachel:,"b' Hi, I\x92m sorry I\x92m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up!\nWhen does Liz\x92s father get here?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh! Ross is sooo great!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were\ngonna to get the kind with the baby.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, the little girl creeps me out.'"
Chandler:,b' Why would the baby creep me out?'
Phoebe:,"b' (writing frantically) You guys, I\x92m sorry, could you please talk a\nlittle slower? '"
Chandler:,b' This is going in your book?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s about relationships. Y\x92know? The traps, the\npitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!'"
Phoebe:,b' And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.\n(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as\nit\x92s a compliment.'
Rachel:,b' (seeing him) Oh hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh! Well let\x92s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch\ncushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?'"
Rachel:,b' All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh good.'
Rachel:,"b' (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?'"
Rachel:,"b' Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.'"
Rachel:,b' You just don\x92t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.'
Rachel:,b' Oh. We?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just\x97I meant y\x92know are\nyou still a \x91We\x92 or are you just \x91You?\x92'"
Rachel:,b' (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?'
Rachel:,b' Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.'
Chandler:,"b' Damn those robots, they\x92re supposed to be our '"
Joey:,"b' Anyway, it wasn\x92t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,\nhe doesn\x92t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was\nreaching for one! Ohh!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, why don\x92t you just get him fired?'"
Joey:,"b' I may have to, I hate to do it, but I\x92m the star! Y\x92know?\nThere\x92s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone\nrings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani. '"
Joey:,b' Wow!'
Joey:,b' I\x92m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!'
Ross:,b' Joey?!'
Rachel:,b' I was just getting him to like you.'
Ross:,b' Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, Joey is not here.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x92ll just wait for him in here!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, it\x92s okay. You can come out.'"
Ross:,b' (coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn\x92t even see you!'
Rachel:,b' Bye!'
Ross:,b' What-what-what the\x97how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know he lost his keys so he was looking for them\x85'"
Ross:,b' (incredulous) In your mouth?!'
Rachel:,"b' No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y\x92know, for like two hours,\nand I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.'"
Ross:,b' You were at the coffee'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, what\x92s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!'"
Ross:,"b' He is my girlfriend\x92s father, okay? It\x92s-it\x92s, it\x92s\nweird!'"
Rachel:,b' Wh\x97You dated my sister!'
Ross:,b' That was different!'
Rachel:,b' What? Why?!'
Ross:,b' This is weird for '
Rachel:,"b' Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let\x92s face it, so far\nthe guy\x92s not lovin\x92 ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We\ncan all go out to dinner, y\x92know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, '"
Ross:,b' How is that important?'
Rachel:,b' Oh it\x92s important!'
Joey:,"b' Apparently, there\x92s like a million guys out there that can play Mac,\nand there\x92s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn\x92t know\nhe could get me fired! What am I going to do?'"
Joey:,"b' Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm\ntomorrow I\x92m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but\nstops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.\n(Exits.)'"
Chandler:,"b' So do you think uh, Joey\x92s more charming than me?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (writing in her book) ""You wish.""'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m not writing about you! I\x92m writing about other people.'
Chandler:,b' Who?'
Phoebe:,b' Marcia and Chester.'
Chandler:,b' Hmm.'
Chandler:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,b' I see what you\x92re doing!'
Chandler:,b' Oh-oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!'"
Joey:,"b' Morning! Hey, how\x92s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!\n(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)'"
Joey:,"b' Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level\nwith me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even\nhave actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second\nchance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.\x92s arm and pulls\nit off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that\x92s why you didn\x92t\nwant me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.\nMeanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can\x92t believe it! God! (A very\nbeautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin\x92? (He and her go over to talk\nand Wayne looks on with envy.)'"
Rachel:,"b' So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly,\noffered to take me.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! I '
Ross:,"b' Yeah, take your time. '"
Ross:,b' (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So\nit wasn\x92t as bad as-as\x85'
Ross:,b' Not all bad.'
Ross:,b' Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.'
Ross:,"b' No! No! Not\x97I don\x92t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!\nI mean I-I have a son, who\x92s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just\nso you know, Carol and I are on '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean\nthat was just a big drunken mistake.'"
Ross:,b' You\x92re back.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh! Whoops! I\x92m sorry, you were talking about Emily!'"
Chandler:,b' We said seven!'
Chandler:,"b' The only way that I said six would be if the seven\x92s, let meet at\nseven, not at six.'"
Phoebe:,b' (Turning around in the chair) Hi!'
Chandler:,b' Oh my good God.'
Phoebe:,b' I know what time you said.'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it\x92s my book to the\nrescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears\nthings up.'"
Chandler:,b' (disgusted) What does it say?!'
Phoebe:,b' I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.'
Chandler:,"b' Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are\nthe queen of everything.'"
Phoebe:,b' Thanks! So are you.'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) I '
Phoebe:,"b' (reading from her book) Mon\x85 (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and\nChester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they\x92re\nsupposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it\x92s at seven.'"
Chandler:,b' So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!'
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s right.'
Phoebe:,b' (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.'
Joey:,b' I can\x92t believe I\x92m going to lose this job!'
Chandler:,b' Oh I\x92m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?'
Joey:,b' Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah? Well, I don\x92t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined\nmy life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Hi, how are ya?'"
Joey:,b' (incredulous) Why should I help you?!'
Chandler:,b' (whispering in Joey\x92s ear) The reason he just said.'
Joey:,b' (happily) What do you need?'
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,b' What are you in love with her or something?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ve been there my friend.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh wow Wayne, it\x92s not really something you can teach y\x92know?\nIt\x92s pretty much something you\x92re born with if you\x97(Off Chandler\x92s\nlook)\x97You-you can teach it! I\x92ll show you right how to do it.'"
Rachel:,"b' I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each\nmarriage.'"
Rachel:,"b' Now wait a minute that\x92s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a\nlot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn\x92t tell me. (Everyone looks at\nher, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? I-I-I\x85 I-I have had enough of this! Y\x92know,\nI-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but\nrespect! So if-if you\x92ve got a problem with me, frankly\x85'"
Ross:,b' God no!'
Ross:,"b' Well if it doesn\x92t matter to her, it doesn\x92t matter to me! (to\nPaul) Still not yelling!'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s okay, I\x92m not so crazy about myself right now either.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh yeah, I guess\x97Yeah! I guess so.'"
Ross:,b' Ohhh! Kids!'
Rachel:,"b' (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how\nnice Ross is!'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s okay Rach, we\x92re not liking Ross right now.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh! I\x92ve got a lot of those too!'
Joey:,"b' Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.'"
Joey:,"b' You got it! And the rabbi\x92s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch\nC.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.\x92s next line.) It\x92s your line\nC.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it\x92s arms and\nadvancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!'"
