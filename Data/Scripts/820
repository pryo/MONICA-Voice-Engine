Rachel:,"b' What?! You mean they\x92re not coming to a social event where\nthere\x92s no men and there\x92s no booze?! That\x92s shocking! I don\x92t care,\nas long as my mom\x92s here.'"
Rachel:,b' What?! My mom\x92s not gonna be here?!'
Rachel:,b' My God!'

Phoebe:,b' Isn\x92t it at three?'
Chandler:,b' Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?'

Ross:,b' Oh cool!'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s great.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I\x92ll (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake\nRemoray, but by night I\x92ll be (In an announcer\x92s voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!'"
Chandler:,b' You\x92ll be perfect for this! That\x92s already your name!'
Joey:,b' But the audition\x92s in a couple hours and I don\x92t even understand\nthe game.'
Ross:,b' Well do you want some help?'
Joey:,b' Oh really? That\x92d be great! You guys can be the contestants!'
Ross:,b' Awesome!'

Joey:,"b' Yeah, isn\x92t that a cool name?'"
Ross:,b' (simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' (simultaneously with Ross) No!'
Joey:,"b' All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don\x92t\nyou tell us a little something about you Ross?'"
Ross:,"b' Well uh, I-I\x92m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a\nson Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh\x85'"
Joey:,"b' I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well Joey, I\x92m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet\nscientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)'"
Joey:,"b' Excellent! Let\x92s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you\x92ll go first.\nWhat is the capital of Columbia?'"
Chandler:,b' Bogota.'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn\nto Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.'"
Chandler:,b' What does a Wicked Wango card do?'
Joey:,"b' I should know that. Let\x92s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we\nare, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.'"
Chandler:,b' Higher or lower than what?'
Joey:,b' This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)'
Chandler:,b' (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I don\x92t believe contestants are allowed to talk to\neach other.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That\x92s good right?'"
Phoebe:,b' What? He\x92s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi\nMrs. Green!'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m so glad you could make it.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah I know. Isn\x92t it great? One less person we have to make small\ntalk with.'
Phoebe:,"b' No look, we\x92ve apologized twice! I can\x92t do anymore than that.\nI know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)'
Rachel:,"b' Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don\x92t even have a\nhousekeeper.'"
Rachel:,"b' Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually\nthink I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that\x92s your mother\x92s\ncrazy.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, however great she was I just can\x92t afford that.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Wh-wh-what? What?'
Rachel:,b' Yes. Yes I do.'
Joey:,"b' All right Ross you\x92re in the lead, would you like to take another\nquestion or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?'"
Ross:,"b' The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I\x92ll take another\nquestion. '"
Joey:,"b' Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.'"
Ross:,"b' It\x92s okay, I\x92m ready.'"
Joey:,"b' No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you\x92re ready to answer the\nquestion.'"
Chandler:,"b' This is ridiculous, he\x92s not gonna hold his breath\x85 (Ross\ncuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia,\nTris\x85Holy cow, that\x92s a big word. Trisc\x85 Seriously look at this thing.\nChandler, how do you say that?'"
Chandler:,b' Let me see that.'
Joey:,b' This one right here. (Ross whines.)'
Chandler:,b' Triscadecaphobia.'

Joey:,"b' No! No, fear of the number 13.'"
Chandler:,b' Fear of '
Ross:,"b' It\x92s possible, they have really sharp edges.'"
Joey:,"b' All right Chandler, you\x92re up.'"
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, I-I believe I\x92m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a\nfree turn?'"
Chandler:,b' This game makes no sense!'
Ross:,b' Y\x92know what? You\x92re just upset because you\x92re losing.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh come on Ross, I think we\x92re all losers here.'"
Joey:,"b' All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.'"
Chandler:,b' Let me think. Let me think\x97Oh! I don\x92t care.'
Joey:,b' You-you must choose Mr. Bing.'
Chandler:,"b' Either, it makes no difference.'"
Joey:,"b' Choose, you jackass!'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92ll take a card.'
Joey:,"b' Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross\x92s points!'"
Ross:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,b' This game is kinda fun.'
Ross:,b' (To Chandler) You don\x92t think it\x92s a little crazy that you get\nall my points just \x91cause you\x85'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each\nother.'
Rachel:,b' Why did you invite my mother?!'
Rachel:,b' She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.'
Phoebe:,b' For how long?'
Rachel:,"b' Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her\nis taxing.'"
Phoebe:,b' She can\x92t hear you.'
Rachel:,"b' What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, if you don\x92t want your mother to move in with you, just tell\nher.'"
Rachel:,"b' You\x92re right. You\x92re right. I mean I\x92m about to have a\nbaby, I can tell my mother that I don\x92t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh\nmy God! She\x92s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)'
Phoebe:,b' I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It\x92s time to\nopen the presents!'
Phoebe:,"b' How about you less important people, let\x92s open your presents!'"
Rachel:,b' Mom that\x92s okay that you didn\x92t get you a gift!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.'"
Rachel:,"b' But mom, I really know what I\x92m doing. I can handle this.'"

Phoebe:,"b' Okay, come on Rach it\x92s present time! Y\x92know you\x92re the\nglue that\x92s holding this whole party together. It\x92s kinda falling apart here.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, this is from your friend at work.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She\x92s holding an item\nwith a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and\nbottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can\x92t be right. Is that a beer\nbong for a baby?'"
Rachel:,"b' Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow!\nWhat\x92s this?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well that\x92s gross, why don\x92t you just take it outside and\nthrow it in a dumpster?'"
Rachel:,b' What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian\nfood?!'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, I\x92d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone\ngasps.) What?! What\x92d I do? What\x92d I do?!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh come\x97(Stutters)\x97Of course I know that. I mean of course you\nnever leave a baby alone! I mean who would\x97she wouldn\x92t be safe as she would be\nwith me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y\x92know what? I think opening the presents\nright now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I\x92m just gonna maybe\nopen them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts,\nand this basket is beautiful.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay mommy, don\x92t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)'"
Joey:,"b' (To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line,\n""Badges? We don\x92t need no stinkin\x92 badges!""'"

Chandler:,b' (disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.'
Ross:,b' (excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler)\nHaaa! (To Joey) I\x92d like a Wicked Wango card!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, it\x92s an audio question, name this television theme song.\n(Starts humming the theme to '"
Ross:,"b' (thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a\nsecond!'"
Chandler:,b' Tell it to the Time Turtle!'
Ross:,b' Shut up! '
Joey:,"b' Yes! Yes, you\x92re back in the lead!'"
Ross:,b' I\x92d like to spin the wheel!'
Chandler:,b' (annoyed) Oh come on!!'
Joey:,"b' All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!'"
Ross:,b' Is there a hopping bonus?'
Joey:,b' Of course!'
Joey:,b' Who invented bifocals? '
Ross:,b' Ben Franklin.'
Joey:,b' Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?'
Ross:,b' Queen Victoria.'
Joey:,"b' Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no\nhopping bonus!'"
Ross:,b' Noooo!!! Every time!!!'
Joey:,"b' Now, over to Chandler.'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92d like a Google Card.'
Joey:,b' Are you sure?'
Chandler:,b' Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!'
Joey:,"b' Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you\x92ve been\nBamboozled!'"
Chandler:,b' Nooo!!'
Ross:,b' Yeah!!'
Chandler:,b' This is the best game ever!!!'
Rachel:,"b' So umm, you\x92re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh mom, I swear I\x92m not an idiot. I\x92ve read all kinds of books\non pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn\x92t think to read the part about what\nto do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby\x92s coming and I\ndon\x92t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?'"
Rachel:,b' Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,"b' (entering, out of breath) Hey!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?'
Ross:,b' I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at\nhim.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.'
Phoebe:,b' Not if you were here.'
Ross:,b' Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.'"
Ross:,b' (excited) A '
Rachel:,b' No. She\x92s going to live with us for eight weeks.'
Ross:,"b' Uh, what?'"
Rachel:,b' Yes! She\x92s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that\nRoss isn\x92t happy.)'
Ross:,"b' What\x97You\x92re not serious. I mean she\x92s a very nice woman,\nbut there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She\x92ll drive us totally crazy.'"
Ross:,b' Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)'
Joey:,b' (announcer voice) It\x92s a pleasure to meet you Ray.'
Joey:,b' (announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!'
Joey:,"b' (to the camera) Hello, I\x92m Joey Tribbiani! Let\x92s play\nBamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?'"
Joey:,"b' Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel\nof Mayhem?'"
Joey:,b' What\x97Why?!'
Joey:,b' Well what\x92s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the\nLadder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden\nMonkey; you yank his tail and boom! You\x92re in Paradise Pond!'
Joey:,b' Well what\x92s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring\ngame that\x92s just people standing around answering questions?'
Joey:,b' (announcer voice to the camera) Let\x92s play Bamboozled!'
Ross:,b' Well we\x85we don\x92t have a garage.'
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it\x92s not absolutely vital that\nyou live with us.'"
Rachel:,b' I do. I really do. I don\x92t know anything.'
Ross:,b' I\x92m-I\x92m sure that\x92s not true.'
Rachel:,b' Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, not a thing.'"
Ross:,"b' Well uh, y\x92know what? Even if she doesn\x92t know anything, I do! I\nhave a son. And his mother and I didn\x92t live together, and whenever he was with me I\ntook care of him all the time, by myself.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' That\x92s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I\nwill be there to\x85to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want\nto do all those things.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes! Yes, you\x92re gonna be so missed.'"
Ross:,b' Well you\x92re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)'
Rachel:,b' Hello?! I still don\x92t know what the hell I\x92m doing!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way.\nYou\x92ll\x97you\x92re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn\x92t believe that.) Hey!\nYou will! Uh look, y\x92know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled\nhelpless little girl who-who still used daddy\x92s credit card. Do you remember?'"
Rachel:,b' I hope you\x92re going somewhere with this.'
Ross:,b' Look at you! What\x97You\x92re-you\x92re this big executive! You are\nmuch more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you\x92re gonna\nbe an incredible mother. '
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Ross:,b' I\x92m telling you.'
Rachel:,b' Thank you. (Hugs him.)'
Ross:,b' Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)'
Phoebe:,b' Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she\x92s\nbeen '
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I\x92d tell her off.'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh!'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' You were fantastic! I\x92m so proud of you!'
Phoebe:,b' You should be!'
Phoebe:,b' You got it!'
Rachel:,b' (closing a book) Okay! I\x92m ready.'
Ross:,b' You sure?'
Rachel:,"b' Yes, I\x92ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.'"
Ross:,"b' All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer\x92s voice) Rachel Green!\nLet\x92s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of\nthe baby\x92s bath water?'"
Rachel:,"b' Uh, put your elbow in it.'"
Ross:,b' Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?'
Rachel:,"b' Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the\nbaby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Check if it\x92s wet, check if it\x92s hungry, burp it!'"
Ross:,"b' Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked\nWango card?'"
Rachel:,b' A card! A card! I pick a card!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry you\x92ve been Bamboozled! You\x92re gonna be a\nterrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I\x92ve lost sight of why we\x92re\ndoing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)'"
