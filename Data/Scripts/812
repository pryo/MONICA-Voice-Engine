Phoebe:,b' Oh really? What was your first?'
Chandler:,b' Well what did it do?'
Chandler:,b' A vending machine?'
Ross:,"b' Hey! Oh, I\x92m so glad you guys are here. I\x92ve been dying to tell\nsomeone what happened in the Paleontology department today.'"
Joey:,b' (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?'
Ross:,"b' Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so\x85.'"
Rachel:,b' They made you head of the department!'

Joey:,"b' You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I\x92ll tell ya\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin\x92 all dressed up and going to a fancy\nrestaurant. I\x92m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it\x92s so much fun!\nI mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not\nfun.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what?'"
Rachel:,b' Huh?'
Joey:,b' Why don\x92t I take you out?'
Rachel:,"b' What?! Joey, you don\x92t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.'"

Rachel:,b' All right?'
Phoebe:,"b' No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off\nall of your top scores, how sad.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. I didn\x92t hear you over all the winning.'"
Chandler:,b' Who cares? It\x92s a stupid game.'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t suck. It\x92s sucks. You suck.'
Phoebe:,"b' Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,\nthen maybe I should just keep it.'"
Chandler:,b' Why do you want to play this game so bad?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah! It\x92s not like it spits out a '
Rachel:,b' Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the\ndoor to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?'
Joey:,"b' No, I\x92m picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her\nsome flowers.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they\x92re my favorite. Thank you.'"
Joey:,"b' And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a\nbrownie. Actually, it\x92s just bag. It\x92s been a long walk from the flower shop and\nI was startin\x92 to feel faint so\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I\x92m going on a real\ndate! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I\x92m wearing underwear that\ngoes up to about\x85(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly\nbelow her breasts)\x85there.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so\x85nice place you got here.\nFoosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, actually that\x92s my roommate\x92s.'"
Joey:,b' I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.'
Rachel:,"b' Ah yes, but he\x92s very protective of me so you\x92d better watch\nyourself.'"
Joey:,"b' Ah\x85 Hey, so this roommate of yours\x85is he good looking?'"
Rachel:,b' Hm-mmm.'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?'"
Rachel:,"b' (laughs) Yeah, but I\x92m pretty sure he\x92s gay.'"
Joey:,"b' No-no-no-no, he\x92s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come\non!'"
Ross:,"b' \x85which brings us back, of course, to Greely\x92s theory of dominance.\n(The bell rings.) Okay, that-that\x92s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the\nFreeman building is?'"
Ross:,"b' What?! That-that\x92s all the way cross town, I\x92m supposed to teach\na graduate seminar there in ten minutes.'"
Ross:,b' Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I\x92m the teacher!!'
Ross:,"b' Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I\x92m\nsorry I\x92m a little late. Ah\x97(Checks his watch)\x97Whoa! A lot late. Let me\nstart by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up,\nI\x92m Professor Geller. Good job today.'"
Rachel:,"b' Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?'"
Rachel:,"b' Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute\nthe three-pound lobster?'"
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know what? Bring her both, and I\x92ll have the same. (The\nwaitress leaves.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date\x97Oh, I almost\nforgot. I didn\x92t pay you the rent check.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We\x92re on a date.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do\nyou have any moves?'
Joey:,"b' No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don\x92t like me for\x97(Laughs.)\nI\x92m sorry I couldn\x92t even get through that.'"
Rachel:,b' I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.'
Joey:,"b' Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine\nsent to my table from a fan.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God. And that works?!'
Joey:,"b' Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I\njust want to have a normal life!""'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you poor little famous man.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night\nto kiss you, but you\x92re so beautiful\x85I don\x92t think I can.'"
Rachel:,"b' (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned\nin. I really almost did!'"
Joey:,"b' Alright, so\x85so tell me one of your moves.'"
Rachel:,b' Alright. So where\x92d you grow up?'
Joey:,"b' That\x92s your move? Boy Rach, you\x92re lucky you\x92re hot.'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on, just answer the question!'"
Joey:,b' (exasperated) Queens.'
Rachel:,b' And so were-were you close to your parents?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.'"
Rachel:,b' Why not?'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know. I guess there\x92s just always been this distance\ny\x92know\x97I mean we both try to pretend it\x92s not there, but it is.'"
Rachel:,b' (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It\x92s\ngotta be rough.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it is. It\x92s really tough. Y\x92know sometimes I\nthink\x97Wow!! Nice move!'"
Rachel:,b' Huh?'
Joey:,"b' ""Where\x92d you grow up,"" it\x92s so simple!'"
Rachel:,"b' Thank you! And now if you\x92ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest\nroom.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' And now you\x92re watching me walk away.'
Joey:,b' Yes I am! Again so simple!'
Chandler:,b' You are not going to believe what I did today!'
Chandler:,b' I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They\nshould change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don\x92t.'
Chandler:,"b' Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the\nboard! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can\x92t\nstraighten his fingers.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Well I\x92ve been playing it for like eight hours, it\x92ll loosen\nup. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they\x92re dirty\nwords.'"
Chandler:,b' Because it\x92s awesome.'
Chandler:,"b' Well y\x92know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it\nis a bit of a challenge.'"
Chandler:,b' It is when you put it together with that one.'
Chandler:,"b' Come on, he won\x92t even know what they mean.'"
Chandler:,b' Have you talked to him lately?'
Chandler:,"b' No-no-no, if you unplug it, I\x92ll have nothing to show for my day!\nIt would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at\nthat! Look at that, it\x92s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM\n(Read Only Memory, it\x92s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!'"
Chandler:,b' With the claw?!'
Chandler:,b' (smiles) Pull my finger\x97(Looks at his hand)\x97My hand is\nmessed up.'
Rachel:,b' I am not gonna answer that!'
Joey:,"b' Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if\nyou had to, if you had to, who would you punch?'"
Rachel:,"b' No one! They are my friends, I wouldn\x92t punch any of them.'"
Joey:,b' Chandler?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but I don\x92t know why. Look at me, I\x92m having such a\nwonderful time!'"
Joey:,"b' Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!'"
Rachel:,b' I know!'
Joey:,b' I never laughed so hard\x97Did you see the wine come out of my nose?'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.'"
Joey:,"b' I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so\nmuch.'"
Rachel:,b' Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.'
Joey:,b' Huh. Huh.'
Rachel:,"b' All right, now don\x92t judge me. I normally wait until my date\nleaves, but you live here. I\x92m ripping into this swan.'"
Joey:,"b' Ah! Okay, well then you don\x92t judge me. I\x92m gonna suck on the\ncellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)'"
Rachel:,"b' So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani\x92s end of the night moves?'"
Joey:,"b' Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips\nlook irresistible. '"
Rachel:,b' How do you do that?'
Joey:,"b' Now you can\x92t tell anyone, but uh\x85I put on shiny lip balm.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I\x92m telling ya. Okay all right, so now\nyou go.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, I don\x92t want to tell you.'"
Joey:,b' Why not?'
Rachel:,b' Because it\x92s embarrassing.'
Joey:,"b' More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at\nhim.) I didn\x92t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just\ntell me!'"
Rachel:,"b' (laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we\x92re\nat the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a\nsecond, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn\x92t sound\nlike anything, but I swear it works.'"
Joey:,"b' (stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why\x97Yeah, that would work for ya\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.'"
Joey:,b' Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then\nstarts to freak out.)'
Rachel:,"b' \x85you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!'"
Ross:,"b' No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the\nphrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!""'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, why didn\x92t you just take a cab?'"
Ross:,"b' Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets\nit\x92ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?\nRockefeller?'"
Rachel:,b' Well you\x92re not gonna be able to keep doing this.'
Ross:,"b' Well I have to. Okay? If I don\x92t, they\x92ll take the class away\nfrom me. And\x85I already put it in my family newsletter.'"
Rachel:,b' You what?'
Ross:,"b' You\x92ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.'"
Rachel:,b' Right. Wow!'
Ross:,"b' Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I\x92m sure I can\nmake it this time. I just\x85I just can\x92t be afraid to get a little bit\x85hit by\ncars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)'"
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie '"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, I still can\x92t believe you haven\x92t seen '"
Rachel:,b' Relax! It\x92s not like it\x92s '
Joey:,b' Have you ever tried to sit through '
Rachel:,"b' Yeah I know it\x92s really boring, but it\x92s like a big deal.\nAnyway, I was thinking about renting '"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah? All right, let\x92s do it tonight.'"
Rachel:,b' Well don\x92t you have that big date tonight?'
Joey:,b' Oh right!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey Joey, can I ask you something?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know! (Pause) I\x92m-I\x92m kinda thinking it-it was\nthe lobster\x85'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah me too, all night.'"
Rachel:,b' Really?! How come we didn\x92t cross paths?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah well that\x92s because uh\x85I stayed in my room. Yeah, you\ndon\x92t want to look in my hamper.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I\x92m sorry that I was hogging the\ngame before\x97(Sees the top ten list)\x97Oh my God! Your friends have some\nunfortunate initials!'"
Phoebe:,b' Chandler sucks! He couldn\x92t have gotten this good!'
Chandler:,b' I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both\nlook at him.) Was it just me?!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I\x92m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a\nstudent, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay,\nwhy don\x92t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where\x85 (Exhales\nagain) Where you will see\x85a uh\x85a bunch of uh\x85red spots. Okay, (Closes his\nbook.) umm, why don\x92t, why don\x92t you all start to read, while I\x97(Passes out\nand collapses.)'"
Joey's Date:,b' Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.'
Joey:,"b' No-no! I\x92m fine. It\x92s just\x85 Hey, can I ask you something?\nHave you ever looked at someone that you\x92ve known for a while and then\nsuddenly\x85suddenly see them a different way?'"
Joey's Date:,b' You mean like from behind?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah. Yeah, that\x85that\x92s exactly it. You\x92re right. Yeah.'"
Joey's Date:,"b' Ew, y\x92know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he\nseemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!'"
Joey:,"b' (deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I\x92m talking\nabout.'"
Joey's Date:,b' Totally! Wow! (Pause) Would you excuse me for a sec?'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches\nher go.) Ehhh.'"
Phoebe:,b' I know!'
Chandler:,b' One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)'
Phoebe:,b' Don\x92t touch me!!'
Chandler:,b' All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t!! I can\x92t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a\nbitch!!!!! '
Ross:,b' Phoebe!!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh hi Ben\x97No!! Don\x92t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh God! Thank God you\x92re home! I\x92m watching '
Joey:,b' (incredulous) Alone?!'
Rachel:,b' Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!'
Joey:,"b' Hey, did you get to the part where they\x92re trapped in the car and\nCujo\x92s throwin\x92 himself at the windshield?'"
Rachel:,"b' No! No! Seriously, what\x92s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what\nare you doing home so early? What happened to your date?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, it didn\x92t work out.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?'
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, okay. Yeah.'"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, I never thought I\x92d say this about a movie, but I\nreally hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel\nwho\x92s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect\nme.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that\x92s him! That\x92s him! That\x92s\nCujo! That\x92s Cujo!'"
Joey:,"b' All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it\x92ll be okay.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God\x85.What\x92s he gonna do now? I can\x92t watch! (Drags\nJoey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?\nAren\x92t you scared?'"
Joey:,b' Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)'
Ross:,"b' So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,\nthe hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we\nsee why he made it to class on time, he\x92s wearing in-line skates and hasn\x92t\ntaken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the\nskates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs\x85 '"
