Rachel:,"b' Ross, my father doesn\x92t hate you.'"
Ross:,"b' Please, he refers to me as \x91wethead\x92.'"
Rachel:,"b' But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all\nright, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you\nlike I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do\ncome to dinner, I\x92ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.'"
Chandler:,b' (leaning in) I\x92ll go.'
Ross:,b' Fine.'
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Ross:,b' Hi Gunther.'
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey, you guys!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Guess what?'
Ross:,b' What?'
Joey:,b' I got a gig!'
Chandler:,"b' See, that\x92s why I could never be an actor. Because I can\x92t\nsay gig.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I can\x92t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!'"
Joey:,"b' Well, it\x92s not a part, no. I\x92m teaching acting for soap operas\ndown at the Learning Extension.'"
Ross:,b' Come on! That\x92s great.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah. It\x92s like my chance to give something back to the acting\ncommunity.'"
Ross:,b' Y\x92know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.'
Joey:,b' (glares at him) I know!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ugh! I don\x92t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if\nyou buy a bed from Janice\x92s ex-husband, that\x92s like betraying Chandler.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in\nEngland this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and\nshe makes the \x91that went right over your head\x92 motion) Woo!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler\x92s your friend...\n(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other\nfriends."""
Joey:,"b' Good evening. I\x92m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for\nsoap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on '"
Joey:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?'
Joey:,"b' Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, \x92Hey, the bell\ndoesn\x92t dismiss you, '"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooooh, nice.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for '"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, yay!'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, it\x92s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I\x92m so,\nso right for it, y'know, he\x92s just like me. Except he\x92s a boxer, and has an evil\ntwin."""
Phoebe:,b' Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this '
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It\x92s\nthat bedroom there. (points to Monica\x92s room)'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, so please, please, please, don\x92t say anything to Chandler.'"
Joey:,b' You want me to lie to Chandler?'
Phoebe:,b' Is that a problem?'
Joey:,b' No.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let\x92s see what you got. All right ya,\nput \x91em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, you\x92re ah, pretty good at this.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young\nmen weren\x92t acting Christian enough.'"
Joey:,b' Ahh!'
Joey:,b' Hey now!'
Joey:,b' Hey!!! Oww!! And I\x92m bleeding.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Oh! Oh!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, great.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow! And I\x92m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I\x92m\nsorry, we\x92ll put some ice on it. '"
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' \x91Kay, put your head back.'"
Joey:,b' All right. I can\x92t see.'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, I have ya. Oh God.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.'"
Rachel:,b' Hi Daddy!'
Rachel:,b' You remember Ross.'
Ross:,b' Nice to see you again Dr. Green. '
Ross:,"b' Ugh, museum.'"
Ross:,"b' There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,\nI never worked at one.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, if you\x92re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a\njoke, I made a joke.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s not a library...'
Ross:,"b' So, Dr. Green, how\x92s the old boat.'"
Ross:,b' It gives it a nice antiquey look.'
Ross:,"b' Wow. I\x92m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel\ngiggles at that)'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)'
Rachel:,b' Aw honey stop! It\x92s not that bad.'
Ross:,b' Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must\x92ve added\nwrong. He only tipped like four percent.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah. That\x92s Daddy.'
Ross:,b' That\x92s Daddy?! But doesn\x92t it bother you? You\x92re a\nwaitress.'
Rachel:,"b"" Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee\nhouse, I\x92d be serving him sneezers."""
Ross:,b' So?'
Rachel:,"b' So. Ross, I\x92ve bugged him about this a million times, he\x92s not\ngonna change.'"
Ross:,b' You really serve people sneezers?'
Rachel:,"b' Well um, '"
Ross:,"b' Thanks again, Dr. Green.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, ah, you don\x92t need that.'"
Ross:,"b' The carbon, it\x92s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,\nthe, the ah, night blindness.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too\nmuch, way, way, too much, it\x92s a sickness really.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something\nabout that.'"
Ross:,b' I know.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh Daddy, no he didn\x92t mean anything by that, he really\ndidn\x92t.'"
Ross:,"b' Nothing I do means anything, really.'"
Ross:,b' Well Mr. Big Shot is better than \x91wethead\x92.'
Joey:,"b' Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I\x92ve never been able to cry as\nan actor, so if I\x92m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a\npair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let\x92s say I wanna convey that\nI\x92ve just done something evil. That would be the basic \x91I have a fishhook in my\neyebrow and I like it\x92 (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend\nfishhook.) Okay, let\x92s say I\x92ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try\nand divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that\x92s how it\x92s done. Great soap\nopera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.'"
Joey:,b' Hey-hey.'
Joey:,"b' Awww, one of my students got an audition. I\x92m so proud.'"
Joey:,b' You bet! What\x92s the part?'
Rachel:,"b' You had to do it, didn\x92t you? You couldn\x92t just leave it\nalone.'"
Ross:,b' Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there\x92s a bug in my\nfood.'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and\nrubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m, I\x92m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something\nand she shouldn\x92t have! All right, I haven\x92t lived here in a while, so I have to\nask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?'"
Rachel:,b' Um. yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' I am '
Rachel:,"b' All right, look, here\x92s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if\nwe act fast, okay. So, I\x92ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn\x92t work.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that\x92s\nwhy you have got to be the bigger man here.'"
Ross:,"b' Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I\ncould be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn\x92t make any difference, except\nthat I could pick your Father up and say \x91Like me! Like me tiny doctor!\x92'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, well can\x92t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For\nme?'"
Ross:,"b' Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay\nwe\x92re never gonna get along.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a\nMother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don\x92t wanna\nhave to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I\x92ll get the bagels.'"
Phoebe:,b' Isn\x92t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!'
Phoebe:,"b' I know, you must\x92ve won like a contest or something! '"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry, okay, I-I wasn\x92t looking, and the store says that\nthey won\x92t take it back because you signed for it...'"
Phoebe:,"b"" When I was you! Y'know what, it\x92s all Joey\x92s fault,\n\x91cause he left his nose open!"""
Chandler:,"b' Knock, knock.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, I\x92m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the\nbed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.'"
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s Monica\x92s bed. What?'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (to Monica) It\x92s a racecar.'
Phoebe:,"b' So. This has always been Monica\x92s bed, what you\x92re just\nnoticing now, how self-involved are you?'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, well it this bed isn\x92t new, how come there is plastic on\nthe mattress?'"
Joey:,b' Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?'
Joey:,b' Whoa. That was really good.'
Chandler:,b' You told him to play the boxer gay!!'
Joey:,"b' Well, I-I might\x92ve said supergay.'"
Chandler:,b' You totally screwed him over.'
Joey:,"b' Because, Monica, the guy\x92s so good, and I really, really want this\npart.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, if you really, really want it, then it\x92s okay.'"
Rachel:,b' (opening the door) Hi Daddy.'
Ross:,"b' Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on\nit.)'"
Ross:,b' Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.'
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) Okay, that\x92s it, I can\x92t take it anymore.'"
Rachel:,"b' What? What? He\x92s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just\nwants to know how you got here.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, please. Sweetie it\x92s hopeless, okay, I\x92m just gonna go.\n(starts to leave rubbing his neck)'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' Look, look I\x92m sorry. It\x92s just that....'"
Rachel:,b' He\x92s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my\nchiropractor...'
Ross:,b' Thank you! That\x92s what I keep saying.'
Rachel:,"b' Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.'"
Ross:,b' Uh.'
Rachel:,b' Well that\x92s his last name.'
Ross:,b' And his first name.'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s Robert Bobby.'
Rachel:,"b' And um, excuse me, he helps me.'"
Ross:,b' Oh-ho please. Ask her how?'
Rachel:,b' With my alignment. I\x92ve got one leg shorter than the other.'
Ross:,b' Argue with that.'
Rachel:,"b' What? It\x92s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.'"
Ross:,b' I know that!'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry, let her?'"
Ross:,"b' What can I do, she doesn\x92t listen to me about renter\x92s insurance\neither.'"
Rachel:,b' No.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?'"
Ross:,b' Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah honey, I\x92m standing right there! Why didn\x92t you just tell\nhim about the mole I haven\x92t got checked yet.'"
Ross:,b' Excellent!'
Joey:,"b' (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you\x92ll\nhave a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the\nrecent, present. And I\x92m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to\nplay a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned\nout, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he\x92s got a two\nyear contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me\nI\x92m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on\nTV. I\x92m sorry, I\x92m sorry, I\x92m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from\nhis students.) Thank you.'"
Joey:,"b' All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh-ho-kay, I\x92m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)'"
Chandler:,"b' Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching\nsound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin\x92! (honks the\nbed\x92s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)\nAll right, I\x92ll leave. My bed\x92s so boring.'"
