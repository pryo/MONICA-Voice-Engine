Ross:,"b' Why, why, why would you dream that?'"
Chandler:,"b' More importantly, was I any good?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, you were pretty damn good.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.\n(Monica pats him on his lap)"""
Rachel:,"b' Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.'"

Phoebe:,"b"" (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill\npress?"""
Joey:,"b"" I don't know. What are you wearing?"""
Ross:,"b' Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my\nmassage clients.'"
Chandler:,b' Pirates again?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this\n""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are.'"

Phoebe:,b' I could do that.'
Rachel:,b' What are you playing with?'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, it's my new beeper."""
Joey:,b' What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?'
Ross:,"b"" No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I\nmean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."""
Chandler:,"b' A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.'"
Rachel:,b' Off to see young Ethan?'
Joey:,b' How young is young Ethan? Young?'

Joey:,"b"" Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean..."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time."""
Joey:,"b' All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.'"

Ross:,"b"" (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right,\nJUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd\nbe a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye."""
Joey:,"b' Hey, hey. How was the first day?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.'"
Chandler:,"b' See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder\nwhat he means) Me.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."""
Chandler:,b' Why not?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."""
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,b' I thought you knew that.'
Chandler:,"b"" Noho. Who doesn't they like me?"""
Phoebe:,b' Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.'
Chandler:,b' What are you talking about?'

Chandler:,"b' Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, forget it.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?'"
Rachel:,"b"" All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to\nRoss, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too."""
