Phoebe:,"b' I-I can\x92t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes\nme nauseous! I\x92m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake\x97ooh! Cake!\n(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.'"
Phoebe:,b' God! Ooh! What is that smell? It\x92s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!\n(She goes to the bathroom.)'
Chandler:,b' Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.'
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b' It\x92s me. It\x92s Phoebe. Listen there\x92s something in here I\nwant to eat, what-what smells so good?'"
Joey:,b' Is it the shampoo? It\x92s guava.'
Phoebe:,b' (she smells his head) No!'
Joey:,b' Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?'
Phoebe:,b' Yes. Yes. Yes. I can\x92t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he\nwants me to eat meat? I can\x92t eat meat!'
Joey:,"b' Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it\x92s a pickle?!'"
Chandler:,b' What are you writing?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, Joshua\x92s coming in tomorrow and since I don\x92t have the\nguts to ask him out, I\x92m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a\ncall sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style\x97what did you throw away?'"
Chandler:,b' Hi guys!'
Joey:,"b' Hey, what have you guys been up too?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the\nCupert-Hewitt museum.'"
Chandler:,b' Without me?!'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Bye. (They kiss.)'
Joey:,b' Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.'
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah, she\x92s-she\x92s amazing. And-and she\x92s so much fun.\nAnd! Y\x92know what? When I\x92m with her, I\x92m fun! I even signed up for\nhelicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She\x92s leaving in two days, I don\x92t\nhave to do it.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, she\x92s got to go back to London. But you know what? I\x92ve\nbeen prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and\nthat\x92s it. Y\x92know.'"
Joey:,b' Hey that\x92s what all my relationships are like.'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, but in Ross\x92s case, they '"
Ross:,b' Pheebs!'
Ross:,b' (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!'
Phoebe:,"b' (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is\ntotally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make\nit think it was getting meat, y\x92know? And I got nauseous.'"
Chandler:,b' Maybe that\x92s because soy-burgers suck!'
Phoebe:,b' Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s sweat. You throw up all morning, you\x92ll have that glow\ntoo.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, here\x92s that trench-coat that you wanted.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,"b' (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don\x92t want you to put your\nhands in the pockets until you are out of the store.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, that\x92s because of a lot of\x85(She imitates someone picking\ntheir nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)'"
Rachel:,b' I know!'
Rachel:,b' Oh?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, congratulations, so do you love her?'"
Rachel:,"b' Huh. Well, uh, that\x92s uh, that\x92s interesting. (She goes over\nand retrieves her note.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it\x92s just an anti-theft device.'"
Rachel:,"b' You need that, you need that too \x91cause obviously, a thief could\njust tear this up. (Rips up the note.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we\nhave to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.'"
Chandler:,b' What are you talking about?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, what\x92 going on?'"
Rachel:,"b' We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it\x92s\nactually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he\x92s not ready to\ndate, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I\nhave the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)'"
Ross:,"b' Well, as much as I\x92d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I\naren\x92t going to be here. All right? I mean, she\x92s going to come by first to say\ngood-bye, and then I\x92ve got a whole special evening planned. So I\x92m sorry, no\nparty.'"
Joey:,b' Awwww!'
Rachel:,b' Surprise!!!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, it was all Ross\x92s idea.'"
Ross:,b' You really didn\x92t know?'
Chandler:,b' Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to\nthe living room.)'
Rachel:,"b' Uhh, because I\x92m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he\x92s\nlooking over here, say something funny.'"
Chandler:,b' Like what?'
Joey:,b' What-what-what is so funny?'
Chandler:,"b' I said, ""Like what?""'"
Joey:,b' Now that\x92s a thinker.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, y\x92know what, y\x92know what? This playing hard to get thing\nis not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She\ndoes a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!'"
Rachel:,b' Care for a cherry?'
Rachel:,"b' No? Y\x92know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my\ntongue. '"
Ross:,b' (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, but we-we have to be at the'"
Ross:,"b' No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very\nshort. It\x92s usually, ""Surprise!"" And then, ""Oh my God, I\x92m so\nsurprised\x97good-bye!""'"
Ross:,b' Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica\x92s knee really hardly\nand Monica winces in pain.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?'"
Joey:,b' A little salami. '
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?'"
Joey:,b' Pastrami. '
Phoebe:,"b' Oooh, yeah. You\x92re a genius.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah. (He goes over to her.)'
Rachel:,b' Up!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.'"
Chandler:,b' Does for me.'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, God! Look at him, he\x92s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab\nhim, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Joey:,b' There was a seen in '
Chandler:,b' '
Joey:,"b' Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl\x85'"

Ross:,"b' Yes, we have something we have to get to.'"
Rachel:,"b' No! You guys can\x92t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole\nbig thing planned!'"
Ross:,b' What big thing?'
Rachel:,"b' (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the\nbottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where\nGunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther\x92s face and decides\nnot to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?'"
Joey:,b' Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)'
Rachel:,b' Yay! Emily! '
Chandler:,b' What are the odds? What are the odds?'
Ross:,"b' (stopping them) Okay, that-that\x92s enough! Y\x92know, let\x92s,\nlet\x92s let someone else play.'"
Joey:,"b' If you didn\x92t want to play, why did you come to the party?'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, my turn!!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!'
Rachel:,"b' It\x92s okay! It\x92s okay! It kicked once, it\x92ll kick again!'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. '"
Rachel:,b' Just a bug.'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know it doesn\x92t matter how much I\x92m craving it.\nY\x92know why I\x92m never gonna eat meat? Because it\x92s murder, cold blooded\nmurder.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. '
Chandler:,"b' There\x92s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the\nsandwich to Phoebe.)'"
Joey:,"b' Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!'"
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.'
Joey:,"b' All right look, y\x92know how-y\x92know how when you\x92re dating\nsomeone and you don\x92t want to cheat on them, unless it\x92s with someone really\nhot?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, totally!'"
Joey:,"b' All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you\x92re going\nto do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!'"
Joey:,b' Feel better now?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I\x92m\ngonna eat like, y\x92know millions of cows.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.'"
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Well, I eat a lot of meat right?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Well, suppose until the baby\x92s born I laid off it. No extra animals\nwould die, you-you\x92d just be eating my animals.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Joey, I can\x92t believe you would do that for me.'"
Joey:,"b' Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There\x92s no meat in beer, right?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked\nfor our check right away.'"
Rachel:,b' No-n-n-n-no! I am '
Rachel:,b' Hi!'

Rachel:,"b' I\x92m fine! I\x92m fine! I\x92m just losing a tooth, it\x92s no\nbig deal. I have a dentist! Y\x92know. I\x92m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.\n(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do\nnow?'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)'"
Joey:,b' (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.'
Rachel:,"b' All right, come on, let\x92s go get your coat.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y\x92know, this bra\x85\nReally, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y\x92know, this used to be my\nbedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not\nhow this is supposed to happen.'"
Rachel:,"b' Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that\nif I could get you here, I could seduce you.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x92m sorry, I thought you needed them!'"
Rachel:,b' Why?!'
Rachel:,b' You like me?'

Rachel:,"b' Oh, now see that\x92s a fancy but.'"
Rachel:,b' But\x85.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua\x92s gone so\nyou and Emily are free to go.'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s okay. She\x92s still in there enjoying her fake party and\nuh, it\x92s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Ross, I\x92m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.'"
Ross:,b' Helps a little.'
Rachel:,b' Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, have a seat.'"

Rachel:,b' You seem to really like her.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed\nthat it was gonna be a two-week thing, y\x92know no commitment.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,\nasking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica\x92s photo albums, I mean you\ndon\x92t do that if you\x92re just in it for two weeks.'"
Ross:,b' You think?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and\nyou\x92re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, you\x92re right.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh my God! Those weren\x92t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!\n(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)'"
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'

Phoebe:,"b' Hm-mm, corn beef.'"
Joey:,"b' Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that\x92s much better. How about a\nlittle of that smoked turkey?'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,b' (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is\nthe baby due?'
Phoebe:,b' Six months.'
Joey:,"b' Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those\nright?'"
Phoebe:,b' Not if I get there first.'
