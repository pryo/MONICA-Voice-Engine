Chandler:,b' Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it '
Chandler:,"b"" Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or\n'self-destructive'..."""
Chandler:,b' Yes please.'
Chandler:,"b"" He's a he?"""
Chandler:,"b"" ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that\nridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,\npossibly, you might be... """
Chandler:,b' You did?'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my\nbreasts, so then I figured maybe not."""
Chandler:,"b' Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first\nmet me?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I think so, yeah.'"
Joey:,b' Not me.'
Ross:,"b"" Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor\ndid."""
Chandler:,"b"" You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?"""
Ross:,"b"" No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I\ntold her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."""
Chandler:,"b"" Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"""
Chandler:,b' WHAT IS IT?!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be\nvague about this.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) '
Ross:,"b"" (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to\nRome."""
Rachel:,"b"" Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to\nRome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome."""
Ross:,"b"" So, uh, how's she doing?"""
Ross:,"b' Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and\nwe still have boyfriends and your career to cover.'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'\nLos. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."""
Ross:,b' She looks so small. '
Ross:,"b"" Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. """
Ross:,"b' Bye, Nana. '"
Ross:,"b"" Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,\nquite.."""
Ross:,"b"" She's not- past, she's present, she's back."""
Ross:,"b"" I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)"""
Ross:,b' '
Chandler:,"b' I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?'"
Rachel:,"b"" (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, you have homosexual hair.'"
Rachel:,"b' So, um, did she...'"
Ross:,b' Twice.'
Joey:,b' Twice?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, that sucks!'"
Joey:,b' You guys okay?'
Ross:,"b"" I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,\nuh..."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone."""
Ross:,"b"" Nono, she's gone."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every\nnow and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand\naround her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And\nDebbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf\ncourse- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little\nyellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."""
Rachel:,"b' Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)'"
Phoebe:,b' Thanks!'
Rachel:,b' Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.'
Joey:,"b"" Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're\ndead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,\nhuh?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the\npencil)"""
Ross:,b' I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.'
Ross:,"b"" (sarcastic) I don't see why not."""
Ross:,"b"" Here's my retainer!"""
Chandler:,"b' Hey, gorgeous.'"
Chandler:,"b"" No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other\npeople have made the same mistake."""
Chandler:,"b' So, uh... what do you think it is about me?'"
Chandler:,"b' ...Quality, right, great.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."""
Chandler:,"b"" No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with\nsomeone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."""
Chandler:,"b"" Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could """
Ross:,b' (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?'
Ross:,"b' I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend\neternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)"""
Ross:,"b' Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)'"
Ross:,"b"" And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?"""
Ross:,"b' (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.\nI can show you something in a silver that may work.'"
Ross:,"b' No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.'"
Ross:,b' Oh my God..'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.'"
Ross:,"b' (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?'"
Ross:,"b"" Some days it's all I can think about. """
Phoebe:,"b"" (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you-you mean your earrings?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" What'd I say?"""
Rachel:,b' (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.'
Rachel:,b' Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.'
Ross:,"b"" What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"""
Joey:,b' (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?'
Chandler:,"b"" Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't\nit?"""
Joey:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.'"
Joey:,"b' Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)'"
Chandler:,"b"" You're watching a football game at a funeral?"""
Joey:,"b"" No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."""
Chandler:,"b' You are a frightening, frightening man.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, I hope they're not ruined."""
Phoebe:,"b' God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!'"
Ross:,"b"" I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,\nthere's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he\nfalls into an open grave)"""
Ross:,"b"" I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised..."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in\nspasm...huh."""
Ross:,"b' What, what is it?'"
Phoebe:,b' You missed a belt loop. '
Ross:,b' Oh! No-n-'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, it's in spasm."""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, no-'"
Chandler:,"b"" Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"""
Ross:,"b' I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.'"
Ross:,"b' Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys\nare the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ooh! That's so nice..."""
Ross:,b' ...Chandler! '
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b"" (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to\nme."""
Ross:,b' Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.'
Rachel: ,"b'(humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?'"
Ross:,b' No.'
Rachel:,b' You!'
Ross:,"b"" Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)"""
Joey:,"b' (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing\ndisability.'"
Joey:,b' Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.'
Rachel:,"b' (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Hey, who's this little naked guy?"""
Ross:,b' That little naked guy would be me.'
Rachel:,"b' Aww, look at the little thing.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?'"
Chandler:,b' Who are those people?'
Ross:,b' Got me.'
Rachel:,"b' Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?'"
Ross:,b' Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)'
Joey:,"b' Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!'"
Ross:,"b"" (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."""

Chandler:,"b"" So how's it going there in Financial Services?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,\nuh... I'm not."""
Chandler:,b' Really.'
Chandler:,b' So- you can tell?'
Chandler:,"b"" So you don't think I have a, a quality?"""
Chandler:,b' He '
Chandler:,"b' Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I\nwanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.'"
