Ross:,b' Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the\ntable.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Well that\x92s no way to sell newspapers. Why don\x92t you try,\n""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!""'"
Ross:,"b' No, Monica\x92s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all\ngasp.) I didn\x92t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all\nthe copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)'"
Joey:,"b' Man, this is bad! And I\x92ve had my share of bad reviews. I still\nremember my first good one though. (Quoting) ""Everything else in this production of '"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' Umm\x85'
Ross:,"b' But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, they all know.'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m so sorry.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah but y\x92know what they say Mon, ""There\x92s no such thing\nas bad press.""'"
Rachel:,b' I didn\x92t write it.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I\x92m not just saying\nthis because I\x92m your friend, I\x92m sayin\x92 it \x91cause it\x92s the\ntruth. You\x92re food is abysmal!'"
Rachel:,b' Ross!'
Ross:,b' (startling him) What?! What?'
Rachel:,b' I am freaking out!'
Ross:,b' Are ya?'
Rachel:,b' My due date is in one week! '
Ross:,b' What are you doing up?'
Rachel:,b' That is seven days!'
Ross:,"b' Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this\nafter\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have\nany of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not\nhave a diaper service!'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s funny you should mention diapers.'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m serious.'
Ross:,"b' Okay look, there\x92s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.\nThere\x92s a great baby furniture store on west 10'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. Thank you. That\x92s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west\n10'
Ross:,"b' (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you\x92re gonna do this, then\nI\x92m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So\x85 (Starts for the bathroom.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I\x92m sorry, one more thing!'"
Ross:,b' (annoyed) Yeah!'
Rachel:,"b' Umm, our situation. Y\x92know umm, what we mean to each other. And I\nmean we-we\x92re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn\x92t that,\nisn\x92t that weird?'"
Ross:,b' (stunned) (thinks) Well uh\x85'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)'
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey uh Monica, I can\x92t remember. Did we say we were gonna\nmeet here or at the movies?'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, I\x92ll see you there. (Starts to leave) '"
Joey:,"b' Sure, I can hang out \x91til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What\nuh\x97How come you\x92re not going?'"
Chandler:,b' I have a job interview I have to get ready for.'
Joey:,b' I thought you already have a job.'
Chandler:,"b' And people say you don\x92t pay attention. No, this is a much better\njob. It\x92s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical\nfactoring for other companies.'"
Joey:,b' Wow! How do you know how to do that?!'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s what I do now.'
Joey:,b' What is it?'
Joey:,b' You cooked him?'
Chandler:,"b' The front page? You really do live in your own little world,\ndon\x92t ya?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh.'
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Rachel:,"b' No-no-no! No, no, no, we\x92re not married.'"
Ross:,"b' We are having a baby together, but we\x92re not involved. (The cashier,\na very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while\nago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at\nhim angrily) Or, yes stranger, we\x92d like this delivered please.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, okay.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah! Actually, that\x92s one of the reasons why we\x92re not a\ncouple.'"
Ross:,"b' I chose those, I\x92m a paleontologist.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh. Oh yeah, don\x92t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds\nlike he\x92s a doctor, but he\x92s not.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God! I\x92m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,\nand I\x92m bored.'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s my gym.'
Ross:,b' I '
Rachel:,b' Hi Pheebs!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost\ngot something that wasn\x92t on the list. A whore.'"
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started\nflirting with him.'"
Phoebe:,b' Well did she know you two weren\x92t married?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,\nwe-we must alert the church elders!'"
Rachel:,b' You don\x92t understand! You didn\x92t see how brazen she was.'
Phoebe:,b' Sounds like you\x92re a little jealous.'
Rachel:,b' No! I\x92m not! I-I-I just think it\x92s wrong! It\x92s-it\x92s\nthat I\x92m\x97Here I am about to pop and he\x92s out picking up some shop girl at\nSluts \x91R\x92 Us!'
Phoebe:,b' Is that a real place? (Rachel\x92s stunned) Are they hiring?'
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey Chandler, why so fancy?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I got a job interview. It\x92s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot\nmore money and I\x92d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, I think I know someone who does that.'"
Chandler:,"b' Me! I do that. So\x85 Seriously, do I look okay? I\x92m little\nnervous.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah! You really\x97You look great.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, just don\x92t get your hopes up.'"
Chandler:,b' Why not?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, the interview\x85'"
Chandler:,b' What about it?'
Phoebe:,b' Y\x92know! You don\x92t make a very good first impression.'
Chandler:,b' (shocked) What?!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh you don\x92t know.'
Chandler:,b' Are you serious?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah.""\nI was like, shhh!'"
Chandler:,b' What is it that I do?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well it\x92s just like you\x92re trying too hard. Always making\njokes, y\x92know, you just\x97You come off a little needy.'"
Chandler:,b' (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?'
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, I\x92m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from\nyou. (Gets up and hurries out.)'"
Joey:,"b' Either eat it, or be in it.'"
Joey:,b' Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there\x92s a new class\ncomin\x92 in.'
Rachel:,"b' All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you\nabout keeping Ben in your life?'"
Ross:,"b' My son? Pretty serious. (There\x92s a knock on the door and Ross answers\nit.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?'"
Ross:,"b' Ah, must\x92ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in\nyour store.'"
Ross:,b' Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living\nroom and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)'
Ross:,"b' Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I\x92m just gonna put this (The\nmoney) back in my pocket, pretend '"
Rachel:,"b' Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs\nshe\x92s holding are arguing.) No! You\x92re a horny bitch! Noooo! You\x92re the\nhorny bitch! No! You\x92re a horny bitch!'"
Rachel:,"b' So you guys go, have a really good time.'"
Ross:,"b' (To Katie) Yeah, I\x92m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.\n(Katie looks worried.) Y\x92know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not\nbecause I\x92m-I\x92m into S&M. (Katie\x92s worried again.) I\x92m\nnot-I\x92m not into anything weird. Y\x92know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is\nuncomfortable.) So, I\x92m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel\nalone.)'"
Rachel:,"b' So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you\nmissed a button.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh okay, I see what you\x92re doing there.'"
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t even believe this! I really come off that badly?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! It\x92s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see\nhow really sweet and wonderful you really are.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh good. Good, because I\x92m sure this interview is gonna last a\ncouple of weeks.'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, don\x92t '"
Chandler:,b' An hour.'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t help you.'
Chandler:,b' Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, all right, we\x92ll just do our best. Okay? So let\x92s\nsay I\x92m the interviewer and I\x92m meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi!\nCome on in, I\x92m uh, Regina Philange.""'"
Chandler:,b' Chandler Bing.'
Phoebe:,"b' Bing, what an unusual name.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I\x92ll let myself out.'"
Joey:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,"b' When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?'"
Joey:,b' Cheese makes me thirsty.'
Joey:,b' All right.'
Chandler:,"b' \x85I think you\x92ll find if I come to work here, I don\x92t\nmicro-manage. I don\x92t shy away from delegating.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Um-hmm, that\x92s good to know. But let\x92s stop focusing on what\nyou don\x92t do, and start focusing on what you do do.'"
Chandler:,"b' (suppressing a smile) What I do do\x85is manage to uh, create an\natmosphere of support for the people working with me.'"
Phoebe:,b' I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.'
Chandler:,b' Hardest thing I\x92ve ever done in my life.'
Phoebe:,b' You gotta go!'
Chandler:,b' Oh! (Stands up.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, don\x92t worry. You\x92re ready.'"
Chandler:,b' Really?'
Phoebe:,b' Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you\x92ll be\ngreat.'
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I\x92m a dork.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,b' Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don\x92t want to go. I\x92m having fun.'
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it\x92s time to go, it\x92s time to go.\n(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)'"
Chandler:,b' \x85also I was the point person on my company\x92s transition from\nthe KL-5 to GR-6 system.'
Chandler:,b' That I did. That I did.'
Chandler:,b' (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.'
Chandler:,b' (trying not to laugh) I see.'
Chandler:,b' (really try not to laugh) Good to know.'
Chandler:,b' No don\x92t I beg of you!'
Chandler:,b' (relieved) Really?!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y\x92know\nI\x92ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard\nto sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn\x92t understand) Duties. (Still\ndoesn\x92t.) Duties! (Still doesn\x92t.) Poo. (Still doesn\x92t.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh my God this doesn\x92t count! Okay? The interview was over, that\nwas the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call\nsecurity! There\x92s a crazy guy out in the hall!'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,b' Hi! You\x92re back from your date!'
Ross:,b' How are you?'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m fine, but that\x92s not important. What\x92s important is\nhow was she?'"
Ross:,"b' Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.'"
Ross:,"b' What\x92s uh, what\x92s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?'"
Rachel:,"b' No! No, she\x92s\x97She was nice. I mean, she\x92s a little\nslutty, but who isn\x92t?'"
Ross:,b' I liked her.'
Rachel:,"b' Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you\nIndiana Jones!'"
Ross:,b' Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!'
Rachel:,"b' No! It\x92s just that, Kate bothered me. '"
Ross:,b' Why? What was wrong with her?'
Rachel:,b' There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, so what\x92s the matter?'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t want you to date her!'
Ross:,"b' (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I\ndon\x92t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it\x92s a terrible thing to\neven think this, and it\x92s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my\nconstant beck and call 24 hours a day! I\x92m very sorry, but that is just the way that\nI feel.'"
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' I won\x92t date. I\x92ll uh, I\x92ll be here, with you, all the\ntime.'"
Rachel:,b' Really? But I\x92m being so unreasonable.'
Ross:,"b' True, but you\x92re allowed to be unreasonable. You\x92re having our\nbaby.'"
Rachel:,"b' (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)'"
Ross:,b' Do you feel better?'
Rachel:,"b' No, not really. You\x92re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I\nhave to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)'"
Ross:,b' Uh Rach?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)'
Ross:,b' Just one thing umm\x85'
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Ross:,b' We live together. You\x92re having our baby. I\x92m not gonna see\nanybody else. Are you-are you sure you don\x92t want something more?'
Rachel:,"b' (pause) Wow! I don\x92t know, maybe. I\x92m\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin\x92 around! (She\x92s stunned) Like you\ndid last night when I had to pee?'"
Rachel:,b' (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin\x92 with you too!\n'
Ross:,b' (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you\x85'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no-no-no-no, no!'"
Ross:,b' \x85that you actually\x85'
Rachel:,b' No that\x92s just\x97(Laughs)\x97That\x92s just \x91cause\nI\x92m such a good messer!'
Ross:,b' Rach?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Ross:,b' The bathroom?'
Rachel:,b' Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)'
Joey:,"b' Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that\x92s\nthe first A I\x92ve gotten since seventh grade, '"
Joey:,b' What the hell!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)'"
