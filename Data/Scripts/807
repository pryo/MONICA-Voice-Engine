Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know uh, I didn\x92t actually do this.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, it wasn\x92t you.'"
Chandler:,b' I got a maid. Yay!'
Chandler:,"b' Uh honey, I know you don\x92t like to relinquish control\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, she\x92s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored\nthe way that you arranged the sponges.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I distinctly remember \x91cause I thought it was a joke. Now\njust give her a chance, okay?'"
Chandler:,b' What\x92s the matter?'
Phoebe:,b' (looking around) Who\x92s cell phone is that? It\x92s just so\nannoying; everywhere you go.'
Ross:,b' I think it\x92s coming from your bag.'
Phoebe:,b' (checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how\x92d you get this number?'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! What an incredible violation\x97and wonderful surprise.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!'
Rachel:,b' Wow! What did he do?'
Phoebe:,b' Shhh! I\x92m talking.'
Phoebe:,b' Are you asking me out? \x91Cause it would be kinda weird since you\njust broke up with my sister.'
Phoebe:,b' No! Wait! I was just saying that so you\x92d think I was a good\nperson. Fight for me.'
Phoebe:,"b' Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your\napartment in two hours.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92ve got friends too. Okay, bye.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! I\x92m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna\nbe so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can\x92t make lunch.\n(Exits.)'"
Ross:,b' So apparently I\x92m available for lunch.'
Rachel:,b' I can\x92t. I\x92m busy. I\x92m apartment hunting.'
Ross:,b' You\x92re moving?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I can\x92t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don\x92t want\nmy child\x92s first words to be, (in a baby\x92s voice) ""How you\ndoin\x92?""'"
Ross:,b' So does-does Joey know you\x92re moving?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I haven\x92t discussed it with him yet, but I know he\x92s\ngonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about\nmorning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s not really porn.'
Rachel:,b' Not so much.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what and if you\x92re looking for a place? I just heard\nin the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?'
Ross:,"b' Well I don\x92t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in\nmy building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel\nlooks at him.) With your permission.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah that would really be great.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn\x92t. I mean if she just died\nthis morning out of respect.'
Ross:,b' Yeah. No. No you\x92re right. '
Rachel:,b' Shall we?'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Hi. I\x92m Ross Geller. I live in the building.'
Rachel:,"b' And I\x92m Rachel, an admirer of the building.'"
Ross:,b' I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I\x92m so sorry for your\nloss.'
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, thank God!'"
Rachel:,b' Ahh.'
Ross:,"b' Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes\nher head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)'"
Ross:,b' Y\x92know I would it\x92s just painful.'
Rachel:,b' So she\x92s really not dead.'
Rachel:,"b' Hmm. Do you think\x97Could you tell me if she\x92s hanging in, in a\none bedroom or a two?'"
Chandler:,b' See? I told you.'
Chandler:,b' (pause) What?'
Chandler:,b' So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front\nof you?'
Chandler:,b' She must\x92ve been planning this for years!'
Chandler:,"b' Honey, isn\x92t it possible that the company that sold the jeans\nmade more than just the one pair?'"
Chandler:,"b' So, shouldn\x92t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we\ngo\x85snooping around her crotch?'"
Chandler:,"b' Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' Maybe this is too weird.'
Phoebe:,b' No don\x92t tear out your eyes!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it\nshouldn\x92t be '"
Ross:,"b' Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates\nthat phrase into Dutch.)'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, we\x92re done.'"
Ross:,b' Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)'
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on\ntide pools?'"
Ross:,b' Really?!'
Joey:,"b' (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.'"
Ross:,b' Sweet!'
Joey:,"b' All right, well finish your coffee; let\x92s go.'"
Ross:,b' Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.'
Joey:,"b' To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you\x92re '"
Ross:,"b' No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, you\x92re switching apartments?'"
Ross:,"b' It\x92s not for me, it\x92s for Rachel.'"
Joey:,b' But Rachel has an apartment.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, but when the baby comes she\x92s gonna want to move.'"
Joey:,b' She is?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, you didn\x92t expect her to live there with a baby did you?'"
Joey:,b' I guess I didn\x92t really think about it.'
Ross:,b' (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther!\nYou\x92re an ezel!'
Ross:,b' Damnit!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' How was the game?'
Joey:,"b' Oh, okay. I\x85I ate way too much.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh.'
Joey:,"b' Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was\ntalkin\x92 to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just\nlet go.'
Joey:,b' I was kinda hoping you\x92d stay.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh but Joey, I have to go. There\x92s no room for a baby here.'"
Joey:,"b' No room? It\x92s a baby. It\x92s like this big. (Holds his hands about\na foot apart.) Y\x92know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.)\nOr-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it\x92s cute, right? Or-or we\ncould put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn\x92t even notice it.\nWhere\x92s the baby? (Mumbles that it\x92s over in the corner.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Honey, it\x92s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby\nchanges everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and\ntrying to score when there\x92s a screaming baby around.'"
Joey:,b' I could use a challenge! It\x92s getting pretty easy.'
Rachel:,"b' Honey, it\x92s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can\x92t\ndo that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.'"
Joey:,b' I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn\x92t have to\nchange.'
Rachel:,b' I know.'
Joey:,b' Y\x92know I blame Ross for this.'
Rachel:,b' I do too a little bit.'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m gonna miss you, you\x92re the hottest roommate I ever had.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, I got in trouble for that before. I\x92ll see you later.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really? That\x92s the thing I\x92m worse at! You\x92ll see.\n(Exits.)'
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hi!'
Chandler:,b' How come?'
Chandler:,b' To see her pants?'
Chandler:,b' Are you sure? Did you see the stain?'
Chandler:,"b' God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?'"
Chandler:,b' Oh dear God!'
Chandler:,b' And yet you '
Chandler:,b' Here\x92s another plan\x85No!'
Chandler:,b' Why?'
Chandler:,b' I fear a jury will see it the same way!'
Chandler:,b' You see that?'
Chandler:,b' All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it\x92s not your bra\nwill you just let the woman clean the apartment?!'
Chandler:,b' You need new clothes.'
Ross:,b' Hi. How is she?'
Ross:,"b' (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some\nbloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)'"
Ross:,b' Oh I don\x92t know that it would.'
Ross:,b' All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?'
Phoebe:,b' Why?'
Phoebe:,b' What sex?'
Phoebe:,b' We didn\x92t have sex.'
Phoebe:,b' (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!'
Phoebe:,b' You-you\x85you had sex with Ursula?!'
Phoebe:,b' You didn\x92t notice she was wearing different clothes?!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y\x92know what? This is too weird.'
Phoebe:,b' So I guess this is it.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, so do you.'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m leaning. This is where I lean.'
Chandler:,b' Brenda a bee!'
Chandler:,b' Yes! It\x92s flown into your blouse and you\x92d better undo your\nbuttons lest it sting you!'
Chandler:,b' You do?'
Chandler:,b' I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I '
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' You gave them to me!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a\nbig ink stain on the crotch.'"
Rachel:,b' What bra?'
Rachel:,b' You mean the one that you\x92re wearing? (Adjusts Monica\x92s pink\nbra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)'
Rachel:,b' What is this?'
Joey:,"b' Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens\nhere, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile\nover the crib. And uh\x97Oh look! Here\x92s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until\nthe baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?'"
Rachel:,"b' You\x92re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And\nyou gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)'"
Joey:,"b' Ahhhhhhhhhhhh\x85. That-that-that\x92s really just to show where the\nbaby would go. Y\x92know why don\x92t I hold on to him so that there\x92s no\nconfusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)'"
Rachel:,"b' But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it\x92s going to be loud.'"
Joey:,b' I\x92m loud!'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s gonna be up all night!'
Joey:,b' I\x92m up all night!'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s gonna poop!'
Joey:,b' Hello!'
Rachel:,b' What about all the women you want to bring home?'
Joey:,"b' Look, if I\x92m bringing home a woman who can\x92t stand being around\na baby, then maybe I don\x92t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we\x92ll just do it\nin the bathroom of the club!'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, are you sure?'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! All right\x97Look, I know sometimes it\x92ll be hard, okay? But,\nit\x92ll also be really\x85really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.'"
Rachel:,b' I want me to stay too.'
Joey:,b' Ohh!'
Rachel:,b' Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It\x92s so cute!'
Joey:,b' I know! I found it on the street.'
Rachel:,b' Are you serious\x97Really?! It\x92s in such good condition.'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Wow! Whoa-whoa what\x92s under the covers?'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know.'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s moving.'
Joey:,b' Ew.'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s still\x97(Screams)\x97It\x92s got a tail! Get it out of\nhere! Get it out of here!!'
Joey:,b' Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)'
Ross:,"b' Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one\nlast kiss. But I don\x92t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!'"
Rachel:,b' Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I\x92m gonna stay here.'
Joey:,b' Isn\x92t that great?'
Ross:,b' (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!'
