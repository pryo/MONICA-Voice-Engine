Joey:,"b' Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize\nit. Show to everybody. Got it?'"
Joey:,"b' All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the\ncard before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a\nlittle while) 5 of hearts.'"
Ross:,b' Real magic does exist.'
Rachel:,b' Wow.'
Joey:,"b' I can\x92t tell you that, no.'"
Ross:,"b' Ah, somebody\x92s at the door on the ceiling.'"
Rachel:,"b' Noo, that\x92s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Why don\x92t you go up there and ask him to \x91step lightly,\nplease?\x92'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I\x92ll go up there, I\x92ll tell him\nto keep it down.'"
Rachel:,b' Good luck.'
Joey:,"b' All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna\nknow how I did it, I\x92ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you\ndidn\x92t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks\nup a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.\nHere, I\x92ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow\nmotion)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs\nand we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the\nrest is unintelligible).'"
Phoebe:,"b' (muffled) Oh, thank you.'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with\na little nouse at the end?'"
Chandler:,b' I just saw Janice. '
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she\nlooked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid\x92s pretzel at them.'"
Joey:,"b' Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke\nup. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed\nme.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.'"
Joey:,"b"" Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."""
Ross:,"b' Hey Chandler, there\x92s a party tomorrow, you\x92ll feel better then.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, y'know what, I\x92m gonna be okay, you don\x92t have to throw\na party for me."""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it\x92s\nsupposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."""
Rachel:,"b' (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.'"
Rachel:,b' I know!'
Rachel:,b' Op.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you got me.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, that sounds great.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think\nwhy would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it\x92s remotely\nrelated to the field they\x92re interested in.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh honey, come on, I\x92m sorry, I didn\x92t.... I don\x92t mind\npaying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,\nthe arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."""
Rachel:,b' (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?'
Rachel:,"b' It\x92s not funny, this is actually my job.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh well then, so I\x92m just going to go back to talking to my friend\nhere. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.'"
Rachel:,b' Yes?!'
Rachel:,b' (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, he\x92s very charming.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, you\x92re just gonna have to try.'"
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin\x92 \x91em\naround...'"
Joey:,b' Chandler!'
Chandler:,b' Hello-dillillio!!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, somebody\x92s feeling better.'"
Chandler:,b' (to Monica) Take off your shirt!'
Joey:,b' Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, '"
Rachel:,"b' (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.'"
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Hi! So I\x92m out having lunch at Monica\x92s and this guy starts\ntalking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at '"
Ross:,b' Wow!'
Rachel:,b' I know!'
Ross:,"b' What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?'"
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh!'
Ross:,"b' And he\x92s, he\x92s a total stranger?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.'"
Ross:,b' Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.'
Rachel:,b' What!?'
Ross:,"b"" Well, I\x92m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop\nin out of nowhere for no reason."""
Rachel:,b' To be nice.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?'"
Joey:,"b' No, only for sex.'"
Ross:,"b' Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about\nme?'"
Rachel:,"b' I didn\x92t have to, because I was wearing my \x91I heart Ross\x92\nsandwich board and ringing my bell.'"
Ross:,b' Uh-huh.'
Joey:,b' Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!'
Chandler:,"b' (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?'"
Chandler:,b' Hi Joey\x92s sisters!'
Phoebe:,"b' (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow. Okay, I don\x92t know how to talk to you.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I\x92m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.'"
Chandler:,"b' No-no-no-no, no, it\x92s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily\nanyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can\x92t we savor the precious moments? (to\none of Joey\x92s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.'"
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good\nguy.'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s excellent.'
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) So, he\x92s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark\ndoesn\x92t want anything in exchange for helping him?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Well, I assume I\x92ll have to take showers with him, but y'know,\nthat\x92s true of any job."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, my apartment isn\x92t there anymore, because I drank it.'"
Phoebe:,b' Where\x92d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the\npresents.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ow, no \x91woo-hooing,\x92 no \x91woo-hooing.\x92 '"
Phoebe:,"b' Why, what happened?'"
Chandler:,"b' Ah, I fooled around with Joey\x92s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,\nthat\x92s not the worst part. '"
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t remember which sister.'
Ross:,b' (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don\x92t tell me men are not nice!\n(points to Chandler) This is men!!'
Chandler:,b' Okay! You don\x92t think I thought of that?'
Phoebe:,b' How can you not know which one?'
Rachel:,b' I mean that\x92s unbelievable.'
Ross:,b' Which one is Gina?'
Rachel:,"b' Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Monica) You see you can\x92t tell which one is which either,\ndwha!!'"
Phoebe:,b' We didn\x92t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!'
Chandler:,"b' Veronica. Look, it\x92s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red\nskirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, when I\x92ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly\nfriendly, and I\x92m sorry.'"
Rachel:,b' That\x92s all right.'
Ross:,b' That\x92s okay.'
Joey:,"b' (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, Joey.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)'
Joey:,b' Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)'
Chandler:,"b' Why can\x92t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.'"
Joey:,b' I just got off the phone with my sister.'
Ross:,"b' Ah, which, which one?'"
Joey:,b' Mary-Angela.'
Ross:,b' Mary-Angela.'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Why don\x92t you ask Chandler, \x91cause he\x92s the one that fooled\naround with her. She told me you said you could really '"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s gotta be the first one.'
Joey:,"b' Really? That\x92s great! You and my sister, sittin\x92 in a tree.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yep, I\x92m in a tree.'"
Rachel:,b' Did he call? Did Mark call?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that\nPhoebe?'"
Rachel:,b' Music. Very nice.'
Rachel:,"b' So, how are you?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah, what\x92s it about?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I do. (they both run out)'"
Ross:,b' Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How\x92s it going. This is the hardest letter\nI\x92ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell\x92s a matter with you? How do\nyou think Joey\x92s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a\nletter?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, that\x92s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.\nWhen actually I\x92ll be in Cuba.'"
Ross:,"b' All right, look, look, you\x92ve got to do this yourself, okay in\nperson. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,\nokay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her\ndown easy.'"
Chandler:,b' What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?'
Ross:,b' Where in Cuba?'
Chandler:,"b' (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing\nhere?'"
Joey:,b' Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m here to see Mary-Angela.'
Joey:,"b"" You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,\nlisten, listen, you got to be cool, \x91cause my Grandma doesn\x92t know about you two\nyet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on\nMussolini's hanging body. Yeah."""
Chandler:,b' Where\x92s Mary-Angela?'
Joey:,b' She\x92s right in there. (motions to the living room)'
Rachel:,"b' I can\x92t believe Mark didn\x92t call. It\x92s Sunday night, and\nhe didn\x92t call.'"
Ross:,b' Bummer.'
Rachel:,"b' (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you\x92re practically giddy.'"
Ross:,"b' No, I\x92m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn\x92t work out. Look,\nRach, I want only good things for you.'"
Ross:,"b' But, you, you don\x92t want to seem too pushy.'"
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As\nin like, to, to his home?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, and you don\x92t mind if I call, because you only want good\nthings for me.'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at\nMonica)'"
Rachel:,"b' (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it\x92s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,\ndon\x92t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I\x92ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my\nnumber at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.'"
Ross:,b' That is so made up!'
Rachel:,"b' (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it\x92s perfect. Oh\nGod, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!'"
Ross:,b' There you go.'
Rachel:,b' He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I\x92d expect nothing less.'"
Rachel:,b' I got to figure out what I\x92m going to wear.'
Ross:,b' High collar and baggy pants say I\x92m a pro.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah! Right! Okay, I\x92ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo\nhoo!'"
Ross:,b' You go get \x91em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in\nsome way?'
Ross:,"b"" \x91Why don\x92t you call him?!\x92 Well, thank you very much!\nY'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically\nremove the boyfriend!"""
Ross:,b' Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy\nis taking my girlfriend out for a meal.'
Ross:,b' No.'
Ross:,"b' Well, yeah!'"
Ross:,b' (shyly) You grow up.'
Chandler:,"b' This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, it\x92s, it\x92s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?'"
Chandler:,"b' So um, Mary-Angela, what\x92s your second favorite?'"
Chandler:,b' Would you just please....give me the receipt \x91cause this is\ngreat. It\x92s top notch.'
Chandler:,b' So will I.'
Chandler:,b' Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn\x92t mean anything.'
Chandler:,b' Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)'
Chandler:,b' (startled) Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he\nducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I\x92m not really in\na, in a commitment kind of place.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ahhhh, you\x92re not Mary-Angela.'"
Chandler:,"b' This is so bad. If-if you\x92re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn\x92t see Mary-Angela)'"
Chandler:,b' No Joey! No Joey! Don\x92t Joey! Joey!'
Joey:,b' What\x92s goin\x92 on?'
Chandler:,b' (pats him on the shoulder) You\x92re it! Now run and hide!'
Joey:,"b' What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?'"
Chandler:,"b' I wasn\x92t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey\x92s\nsisters gasp) Look, I\x92m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really\nsimilar.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother\x92s not\ngoing to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?"""
Joey:,"b' Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you\x92d\nbe on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!'"
Chandler:,"b' Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want\nyou to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you\x92re my best\nfriend. I would never do anything like this ever again.'"
Joey:,"b' No! No! No! No, I\x92m not going to punch Chandler.'"
Joey:,"b' No you won\x92t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe\nhim, he\x92s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you\x92ve got one more apology to make, all\nright, you\x92ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, absolutely!'"
Joey:,b' All right.'
Chandler:,"b' You\x92ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister\x92s, but he\nstill doesn\x92t know which one is Mary-Angela.)'"
Joey:,"b' Cookie, now you can punch him!'"
Chandler:,b' What?! (Cookie punches him)'
Rachel:,b' (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' What are you doing here?'
Ross:,"b"" Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)\n"""
Rachel:,b' Oh.'
Ross:,b' Hi. (kisses her)'
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,b' How\x92d did it go?'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank\nGod Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy\nand wouldn\x92t shut up."""
Ross:,b' I\x92m so proud of you.'
Rachel:,b' Me too!'
Ross:,"b' Listen, I\x92m ah, I\x92m sorry I\x92ve been so crazy and jealous\nand, it\x92s just that I like you a lot, so...'"
Rachel:,b' I know.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I did!'"
Rachel:,"b' (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)'"
Ross:,b' Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh well y'know. (laughs)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Ick, you were eavesdropping.'"
Rachel:,"b' Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really\nhappens to like me.'"
Ross:,b' Maybe he\x92s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?'
Ross:,b' Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?'
Joey:,"b' All right, that\x92s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy\nis going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)\nBut, is he a big guy?'"
Ross:,"b' Ah, we\x92ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)'"
Phoebe:,b' Thanks you guys! Thank you.'
Chandler:,b' Don\x92t worry.'
Phoebe:,"b' God, I hope they kick his ass!'"
Rachel:,"b' Honey, I\x92m sorry.'"
