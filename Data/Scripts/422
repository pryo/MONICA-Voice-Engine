Chandler:,"b' (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!'"
Ross:,"b' So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning\nbachelor parties, don\x92t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, it\x92s awkward. It\x92s awkward. It\x92s awkward.'"
Ross:,b' I sort\x92ve already asked Chandler.'
Joey:,b' What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!'
Ross:,"b' Joey, I figured you\x92d understand. I mean, I-I\x92ve known him a lot\nlonger.'"
Joey:,"b' Come on Ross! Look, I-I don\x92t have any brothers; I\x92ll never get\nto be a best man!'"
Chandler:,b' You can be the best man when I get married.'
Joey:,b' (pause) I\x92ll never get to be a best man!'
Ross:,"b' (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never\nget to be yours at all?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no-no, you\x97yeah, of course you get to be my best man.'"
Joey:,b' (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you\njust said I could!'

Chandler:,"b' Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, see, I don\x92t think it\x92s gonna that difficult considering\nthis one '"

Chandler:,"b' See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.)\nHave fun planning your mellow bachelor party.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, there\x92s gonna be strippers there. He didn\x92t say anything\nabout no strippers.'"
Chandler:,"b' He just said, ""No strippers.""'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I chose not to hear that.'"
Rachel:,b' Little village people.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, that is so sweet!'"
Rachel:,"b' Huh. Except, Phoebe\x92s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she\x92s always wanted!'"
Phoebe:,"b' What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me\nfeel better to give me stuff that I can\x92t use for another two months?! This sucks!\nAll right, what\x92s my next present?!'"
Ross:,"b' Hey listen man, about the stripper\x85'"

Chandler:,b' Central Perk?'
Joey:,"b' Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don\x92t-don\x92t forget your shirt. (He gives\nGunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)'"
Ross:,"b' Hey-hey, what are those?'"

Joey:,"b' Okay, hey, museum geeks, party\x92s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice\nlady. There you go. Back to your parent\x92s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit\nand Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out!\nHere you go. All right.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah!'

Joey:,b' Yeah. I\x92ll let you play with my duck.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, (realises he doesn\x92t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that\nthe ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it\x92s empty and starts to panic.)'"
Joey:,"b' (running and banging on Chandler\x92s door) The stripper stole the\nring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper\nstole the ring!'"
Chandler:,b' (opening the door) What?'
Joey:,b' The ring is gone!'
Chandler:,"b' Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this\x97Ah-ha-ha!!\nYou lost the ring! You\x92re the worst best man ever!'"
Joey:,"b' Dude, this isn\x92t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,\neverything\x92s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper\x92s gone and the ring is\ngone!'"
Chandler:,b' You slept with the stripper?'
Joey:,b' Of course!! (Shrugs.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Hi, guys.'"
Rachel:,b' Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe\x92s way.)'
Phoebe:,"b' I-I wanted to apologise if I\x97y\x92know seemed a tad edgy\nyesterday at my shower. Y\x92know it\x92s just the hormones, y\x92know.'"
Rachel:,b' No we\x85'
Rachel:,"b' \x85hormones, yeah.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.\n(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Good. Y\x92know\x97no-no, okay, it\x92s-it feels like\neverything\x92s been about me lately, so what\x92s happening with you?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to\nRoss\x92s wedding.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh!'
Rachel:,"b' It just might be too hard, given the history and all that\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street\nand this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, h-how is this like that?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, let\x92s see, it\x92s not. Really, like that. Because, you see\n'"
Rachel:,"b' (starting to cry) I\x92m-I\x92m sorry, I just thought that\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)'"
Joey:,"b' Ugh! I don\x92t know what I\x92m going to do! I called the company\nthat sent and th-they don\x92t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this\nisn\x92t an emergency, then what is?'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey guys!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey\x85'
Ross:,"b' I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And\nthe guys from work had a blast. Y\x92know, one of them had never been to a bachelor\nparty before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so\x85'"
Joey:,"b' So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that\x92s nice!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, right!'"
Joey:,"b' I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for\nmyself, I might want to get one of those\x85'"
Ross:,"b' That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and\nthe clothes on her back were all she had with her.'"
Chandler:,"b' So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little\nsqueeze.)'"
Ross:,"b' Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride\nwho has worn it has had a long and happy life.'"
Chandler:,"b' So you might say, it\x92s a magic ring.'"
Joey:,"b' (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.'"
Ross:,b' My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!\nH-how?! How could this all happen?!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why\ndon\x92t you be my best man.""'"
Ross:,"b' (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I\x92m gonna call the\ncops!'"
Joey:,"b' Dude, I screwed up, you don\x92t have to turn me in!'"
Ross:,b' Not on you! On the stripper!'
Joey:,"b' Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they\x92re gonna look into\nit right after they solved all the murders.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, well, we\x92ll call the company that sent her!'"
Joey:,"b' I did that too! They wouldn\x92t give me her real name or her number.\nThey said, ""If I bothered them again they\x92d call the police."" I said,\n""If you talk to the police, you tell them I\x92m missing a ring!""'"
Ross:,"b' So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there\x92s\nnothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!'"
Joey:,"b' Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her\ncome to my office?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, that sounds like fun, but we\x92ve got a ring to find!!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (sips it) It\x92s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of\nrelief.) Oh, thanks.'"
Rachel:,b' Good.'
Phoebe:,b' (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)'
Rachel:,b' What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.'"
Rachel:,b' You what?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that\nwas '"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. It\x92s okay. We\x92re gonna be okay. Y\x92know what?\nIt\x92s okay. I\x92m gonna, I\x92m gonna, I\x92m gonna boil some water and just\nrip up some sheets!'"
Phoebe:,"b' No. It\x92s all right; it\x92s probably false labour. They said\nthat, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know!'
Joey:,"b' All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.\nAnd-and when she comes in hopefully, she won\x92t recognise you because, well, why would\nshe? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I\x92ll\nbe uh, Mr. Wong.'"
Ross:,b' Diverse.'
Chandler:,b' (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all\nturn there backs on her.)'
Ross:,b' Where\x92s my ring? My dead grandmother\x92s wedding ring? Where is\nit? Where is it?'
Chandler:,"b' Way to be cool, man.'"
Joey:,"b' There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!'"
Ross:,b' We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!'
Chandler:,b' Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn\x92t\ntake it, and I didn\x92t take it; and you (Chandler) didn\x92t take it, then who did?\n(The duck quacks.) Shh! We\x92re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the\nsame moment and stare at Joey, who doesn\x92t get it. After a short pause, with the duck\nstill quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)'"
Rachel:,b' I still don\x92t get how you know when it\x92s false labour.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, do you '"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I guess. I mean\x85 I don\x92t know, it\x92s just, I guess I\nknow it\x92s going to be over soon.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, isn\x92t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I know. It\x92s just y\x92know usually when you\x92re, when\nyou\x92re done with the pregnant thing, y\x92know, then you get to do the mom thing.\nI\x92m gonna be y\x92know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay that\x92s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself\ninto, it\x92s just that now that they\x92re in me it\x92s like, it\x92s like I\nknow them y\x92know, I mean-I mean, it\x92s just not gonna be easy when these little\nbabies have to go away.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, okay.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, really. Really, Pheebs, you\x92re not gonna be the one worrying\nabout saving for college, or yelling at them when they\x92re bad, y\x92know, or\ndeciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won\x92t calm down. Y\x92know?'"
Rachel:,b' And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,b' Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!'
Rachel:,"b' And y\x92know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.'"
Phoebe:,b' They are gonna love me.'
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Phoebe:,b' Thanks you guys! Again.'
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re the best. Thanks. Oh! '
Phoebe:,b' Just kidding. Ahh!'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Got cha again, you guys are so easy.'"
Joey:,b' If anything should happen to him\x85'
Ross:,b' Joey! The vet said it\x92s a simple procedure.'
Joey:,b' So! Things can go wrong! You don\x92t know! What if he doesn\x92t make\nit?!'
Chandler:,"b' He will, Joe.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, but what if he doesn\x92t? He\x92s such a good duck.'"
Joey:,"b' I\x92m so worried about him, y\x92know?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,\nand then does a double-take realising where it\x92s been.)'"
Joey:,b' H-h-h-how\x92s the duck?'
Joey:,"b' Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.'"
Ross:,"b' No, that\x92s all right.'"
Joey:,"b' No, it\x92s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let\nyou down!'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, come on, it\x92s not your fault.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it is! You wouldn\x92t have lost the ring, right? Y\x92know\nwhat, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, you should.'"
Joey:,"b' Now, don\x92t argue with me\x85'"
Ross:,b' Hey! Hey! Hey! '
Chandler:,b' Really?'
Joey:,b' Really?'
Ross:,"b' Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are\nmy\x85 I mean, I\x92m lucky to have just one good\x85 (They all start getting\nemotional.)'"
Chandler:,b' Thanks man.'
Joey:,b' (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so\nthat they can\x92t see him cry.)'
Chandler:,b' What a baby.'
Ross:,b' Total wuss!'
