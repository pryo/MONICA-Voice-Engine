Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?'
Joey:,"b"" No. Y'know how we\x92re always saying we need a place for the mail."""
Chandler:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next\nstep.'"
Chandler:,b' You\x92re building a post office?'
Joey:,"b' No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It\x92s a\none day job, max.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!\nThose are snug.'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente\x92s.'"
Joey:,b' Power saw kinda got away from me there.'
Rachel:,b' (joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs. '
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Any sign of your brother?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, but he\x92s always late.'"
Rachel:,b' I thought you only met him once?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know,\n\x91Frank\x92s always late.\x92"""
Rachel:,"b' Well relax, he\x92ll be here.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I know, I\x92m just nervous. Y'know it\x92s just y'know\nMom\x92s dead, don\x92t talk to my sister, Grandma\x92s been sleeping a lot lately.\nIt\x92s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.\nYou\x92re so sweet to wait with me."""
Rachel:,"b' Well, actually Gunther sent me. You\x92re not allowed to have cups out\nhere, it\x92s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)'"
Chandler:,b' Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?'
Chandler:,"b' All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put\nhim on her freebie list.'"
Joey:,b' Her what?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that\nwe can sleep with, and the other one can\x92t get mad.'"
Ross:,"b' Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex\nwith celebrities.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,\nJessica Rabbit.'"
Rachel:,"b' Now, you do realize that she\x92s a cartoon, and way out of your\nleague?'"
Chandler:,"b' I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop\nout of her head.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, Monica, who would yours be?'"
Joey:,"b' It\x92s just a game Mon. (makes a \x91Can-you-believe-her\x92 face\nto the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t know, I guess, Chris O\x92Donnel, John F. Kennedy,\nJr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.'"
Ross:,b' Spiderman?'
Rachel:,b' Hardy Boy.'
Chandler:,b' Peter Parker.'
Ross:,b' Thank you.'
Rachel:,"b' What about you honey, who would be on your list?'"
Ross:,"b' Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First,\nI\x92ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....'"
Chandler:,b' (coughing) What a geek!'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.'
Phoebe:,b' This is everybody. This is Ross.'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,b' Chandler.'
Chandler:,b' Hi.'

Joey:,b' Hey-hey!'
Phoebe:,b' This is Monica.'
Phoebe:,b' And this is Rachel.'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m gonna get coffee.'
Chandler:,"b' We don\x92t, really.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we\x92re gonna connect, y'know bond, and\neverything."""
Chandler:,"b' You know, we don\x92t really take advantage of living in the city.'"
Joey:,b' I know.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. Did I get \x91ya?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, you didn\x92t get me!! It\x92s an electric drill, you '"
Joey:,"b' Calm down, do you want this unit or not?'"
Chandler:,b' I do '
Joey:,"b' Well, you should\x92ve told me that before, I\x92m not a mind reader.\nHey, we\x92re out of beer. I\x92m going to Monica\x92s.'"
Chandler:,"b' Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom\nhalf of the door.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those\ndesigner tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.'"
Joey:,"b' Nothing. It\x92s just old and dingy, that\x92s all.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to\nbe. (Monica gasps) Yeah.'"
Joey:,"b' Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes\nright off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in\nhis tight pants.)'"
Joey:,"b' (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of\nthis stuff is glued down. It\x92d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should\njust leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)'"
Joey:,b' Eh! There you go.'
Phoebe:,"b' (sits up) Oh, ew!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?\nBecause I can, and my Mom couldn\x92t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was\nsomething I got from our Dad."""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can\x92t)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can\x92t. We don\x92t have\nthat....'"
Phoebe:,b' Feburary 16th.'
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, that\x92s close. When\x92s yours?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x92ve got three of my five.'"
Rachel:,"b' Three of your five, what?'"
Ross:,b' Celebrities I\x92m allowed to sleep with.'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s hard okay, I only have two spots left.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....'"
Chandler:,"b' Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.'"
Ross:,b' Susan Sarandon.'
Chandler:,"b"" Eh, y'know what, she\x92s to political, she probably wouldn\x92t\nlet you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."""
Ross:,b' And!! Isabella Rosselini.'
Chandler:,"b"" Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she\x92s too\ninternational, y'know she\x92s never gonna be around."""
Rachel:,b' So?'
Chandler:,"b' So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who\x92s gonna be in the\ncountry like all the time.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, \x91cause that\x92s why you won\x92t get Isabella Rosselini,\ngeography.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.'"
Phoebe:,b' So is it like art?'
Phoebe:,"b' Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I\x92m just gonna go to bed, I\nthink the fumes are giving me a headache."""
Phoebe:,"b' G\x92night, bro.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case."""
Phoebe:,b' No kind. He just makes it up.'
Phoebe:,"b"" So far, it kinda blows. I don\x92t know, I just thought y'know that\nhe\x92d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and\nconnected and...."""
Phoebe:,b' Ah!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, how do you play the shadow game?'"
Phoebe:,b' I just asked you.'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t have time for this.'
Phoebe:,b' Which you just gave up really quickly.'
Chandler:,b' (entering) Have you seen Joey?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of\nhis pants.) Y\x92know what it\x92s my fault really, because the couch is usually where\nwe '"
Joey:,"b' (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those\ntiles.'"
Chandler:,b' What\x92s going on?'
Chandler:,b' Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!'
Chandler:,b' He started mine first!'
Phoebe:,"b' Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) \x91Hello. (listens) Oh my\nGod, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can\x92t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have\ncompany. (listens) Yeah, no look, that\x92s all right I\x92ll come in.\x92 (hangs up\nphone) Um, Frank, I\x92m really sorry but I have to go to work. It\x92s-it\x92s one\nof my regulars and he\x92s insisting that I do \x91um.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh! I\x92m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, y'know we don\x92t call it that, but yeah!"""
Phoebe:,b' All righty. I\x92ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come\nwith me?'
Phoebe:,"b"" No, no, you can get one yourself. It\x92ll be on the house! Y'know\nwhat are big sisters for?"""
Phoebe:,"b' No, no, no, I wouldn\x92t do you myself, I mean that would be weird.\nYeah, no, I\x92ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun!\nHey! Are you excited?'"
Chandler:,"b' What, like a number?'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey! '
Chandler:,b' Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)'
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x92m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little\ncard)'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, it\x92s about time.'"
Joey:,"b' Ooh, very official.'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer."""
Ross:,b' That would be me.'
Rachel:,"b' All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,\nElizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? '"
Ross:,"b' Hey, it\x92s my list.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!-Hey! What\x92s going on?'
Phoebe and Girl:,b' Ewww!!!'
Phoebe:,b' You can\x92t have sex with her!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like\nfive minutes.'"
Phoebe:,b' (turns around and hits Frank) So that\x92s what you thought I did!!\nGod! That\x92s not what I do!'
Phoebe:,b' Nooo! Why would you think that?'
Phoebe:,"b' Whatever, it\x92s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.'"
Phoebe:,b' You really thought it was perfect?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?'"
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t....'
Phoebe:,"b' Right, okay, um-mm.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, I-I wasn\x92t hopping mad, y'know."""
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now,\nthis.'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,b' She wasn\x92t a hooker.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, on three. One....Two....'"
Joey:,b' Why don\x92t we just go on two.'
Chandler:,b' Why two?'
Joey:,b' Because it\x92s faster.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this\n\x91two\x92 talk.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Joey:,"b' All right, but in the future...'"
Ross:,b' Okay!! Okay!!'
Rachel:,b' Come on!'
Ross:,"b' Heavy thing, not getting lighter!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, one...two...'"
Joey:,b' So we are going on two?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, good job Joe.'"
Joey:,"b' Wow, it\x92s big!'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! '"
Joey:,"b' Maybe, my ruler\x92s wrong.'"
Phoebe:,b' Maybe all the rulers are wrong.'
Joey:,"b' Look it\x92s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a\nlittle of my door.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how \x91bout it blocks\nnone of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move\nit, but it doesn\x92t move.)"""
Joey:,"b' Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,\ndouble tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy\nnods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.'"
Ross:,b' Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)'
Ross:,b' Damn! I can\x92t believe I took her off my list.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, maybe.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh-oh, you lie.'"
Ross:,b' What you don\x92t think I\x92d go up to her?'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.'"
Rachel:,"b' You know what honey, you go ahead, we\x92ll call her an alternate.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, hold my crawler.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' Honey, he\x92s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I\x92m just\nsorry we don\x92t got popcorn.'"
Ross:,"b' (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I\x92m Ross, you don\x92t know me, but I\x92m\na big, big fan of yours. I mean, '"
Ross:,"b' Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that\x92s okay, see we have an understanding,\num, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I\x92m allowed\nto sleep with you. No, no, no, it\x92s flattery.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don\x92t, don\x92t just dismiss\nthis so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...'"
Ross:,"b' Um, yeah.'"
Ross:,"b' Um, no.'"
Ross:,"b' But, okay.'"
Ross:,"b' Um, see, but that\x92s not the final draft.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler\n(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped\nyou for Wynona Rider, local.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' (to the rest of the gang) We\x92re just gonna be friends.'
Joey:,"b"" Y'know what?"""
Chandler:,b' Umm?'
Joey:,b' I bet \x91ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)'
Chandler:,b' I\x92ve got five bucks says you can\x92t.'
Joey:,"b' Get out your checkbook, mister.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I think I have the cash.'"
Joey:,b' You are dogged man! I totally fit!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so\nthat the doors won\x92t open) I\x92m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack\nbetween the door and frame) Here you go.'"
Joey:,"b' Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.\nLincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks\nare on me!'"
