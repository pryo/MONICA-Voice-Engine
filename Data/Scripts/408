Joey:,b' (answering phone) Hello.'
Chandler:,"b' (on phone) Hey, it\x92s me. I know you can\x92t stand to be in the\nsame room as me, so I just thought I\x92d try and apologize over the phone. All I\x85\n(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)'"
Joey:,b' (answering phone) Hello.'
Chandler:,"b' Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I\x92m\x85\n(Joey hangs up the phone again.)'"
Joey:,b' (answering phone) Stop callin\x92!!'
Joey:,b' All right!'
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Look everyone, it\x92s the spirit of Thanksgiving!'"
Rachel:,b' So are things with you and Joey any better?'
Chandler:,"b' They couldn\x92t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last\nnight, just trying to get him to talk to me.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those\nplug-in telephone headsets huh?'"
Ross:,b' Should we '
Rachel:,b' You shouldn\x92t.'
Phoebe:,"b' Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new\nbusiness and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then\nwe each only buy one gift. And-and there\x92s the added mystery of who gets who.'"
Ross:,b' Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don\x92t know why I do that.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x92m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.'"
Rachel:,"b' I know, but all that work you\x92re doing to get it ready, I\njust\x85 (goes into her bedroom.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,\n\x91cause I wanna trade for her.'"
Phoebe:,b' I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!'
Chandler:,b' Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?'
Phoebe:,"b' Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it\x92s like\nimpossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let\x92s trade!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh that\x92s not true! That\x92s not true! I got her that backpack\nand she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off\nwith it\x85 (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe\x92s faces.) Oh, there was no big\ndog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on\nit\x85 (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Ohh.'
Chandler:,"b"" Op, y'know what though, it\x92s kind\x92ve a girlie briefcase."""
Chandler:,"b' Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!'"
Phoebe:,"b' You don\x92t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren\x92t here, you can\nwatch the parade if you want.'"
Chandler:,b' Thanks.'
Phoebe:,"b' God, what happened?!'"
Rachel:,b' (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!'
Chandler:,"b' Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Open it up, let me see.'"
Chandler:,b' Well maybe you should put some ice on it.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, God it looks bad.'"
Rachel:,"b' Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.'"
Chandler:,b' He\x92s really picky about his patients.'
Phoebe:,"b' Honey, you\x92ve got to go. What\x92s his office number?'"
Phoebe:,"b' (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I\x92m calling on behalf of Monica Geller\x92s\neye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He\x92s out of town,\nbut does she want to see the on-call doctor?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes! She\x92s very excited about that.'
Phoebe:,"b' This is so cool, \x91til Monica gets back, it\x92s like I\x92m\nhead chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and\nthen decides to add it to the dish.)'"
Ross:,"b' Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, get out of my kitchen!'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with\nJoey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed\nthe door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.'"
Phoebe:,b' All right I\x85 I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking\nquestion.'
Ross:,"b' So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I\x92m already\ngetting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh y\x92know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.'"
Ross:,"b' Really?! Wow! That\x92s-that\x92s so nice, what are you gonna get me?'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your\noffice.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no-no, you don\x92t want to do that, then you\x92re gonna\nget stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, that\x92s not true! I\x92ve got her lots of stuff she never took\nback.'"
Chandler:,b' Like?'
Ross:,"b' Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.'"
Chandler:,b' When was the last time you saw her wear it?'
Ross:,"b' Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Big dog?'
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' What are you doing?'
Joey:,b' I\x92m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.'
Ross:,b' Everything? Even the TV?'
Joey:,b' No! I\x92m putting that in my room.'
Ross:,"b' Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don\x92t you think you\ncould at least hear the guy out?'"
Joey:,"b' Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would\nyou hear him out?'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?'"
Joey:,b' Five years. '
Ross:,b' You\x92ve sentenced him?!'
Joey:,b' Hey! Don\x92t do the crime if you can\x92t do the time.'
Ross:,"b' Joey, the guy\x92s your best friend.'"
Joey:,"b' No, '"
Ross:,"b' Oh, who? Me?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Wow! I\x92m honored! And y\x92know what I\x92m gonna do as my first\nact as your best friend?'
Joey:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' I\x92m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.'
Joey:,b' All right. But if you weren\x92t my best friend.'
Chandler:,"b' I walk into a room and he won\x92t even talk to me, he just mumbles\nsomething in Italian. And I'"
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?'"
Chandler:,b' Hey Joe.'
Joey:,b' (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)'
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, so cute, that I\x92m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey! I\x92m sorry! That\x97(sees that Joey is about to leave)\nwhere are you going?'
Joey:,b' My folks.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an\napartment.'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, y\x92know at first I thought we could talk about this y\x92know,\nwork it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don\x92t think I\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that\nI\x92ll stop seeing her?'"
Joey:,"b' Look, it\x92s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just\nreminds me of what you did. And I don\x92t want to live with some one who doesn\x92t\nknow what it is to be a friend. So, I\x92ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler\ngrabs his bag and stops him.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! You did! And that\x92s why I\x92m leaving.'
Chandler:,"b' All right look, if you\x92re not gonna stay for me, then at least\nstay for them! Okay, they have had a '"
Joey:,"b' When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit\nfor like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about\nhow I let you down! '"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! But if would\x92ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn\nout to be, I wouldn\x92t have worried about it so much! See you around!'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be\nsomething that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in\nit for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?'"
Joey:,b' We\x92ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)'
Ross:,b' He\x92s coming here for Thanksgiving!'
Rachel:,"b' I know, it\x92s sick.'"
Rachel:,b' Because it\x92s Richard\x92s son! It\x92s like inviting Greek\ntragedy over for dinner!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I can see where I\x92d be your best shot but, no. I\x92m\nsorry, but I think it\x92s twisted.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' (coming out of the bathroom) What\x92s twisted?'
Joey:,b' Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!'
Chandler:,"b' (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad\nidea to me.'"
Rachel:,b' Is he okay in there?'
Joey:,b' He\x92s fine!'
Ross:,"b"" Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard\x92s son,\nyou\x92d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather."""
Rachel:,"b' So now, what exactly is the point of the box?'"
Joey:,b' Chandler?'
Chandler:,"b' The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through\nthe air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another\nfinger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a\nthird finger), it hurts!'"
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last\nyear? Can I see it?'"
Rachel:,b' (worried) Why?'
Ross:,b' I just wanna check something.'
Rachel:,b' Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)'
Ross:,"b' (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we\x92ll\nsee.'"
Chandler:,b' Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)'
Rachel:,b' (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I\nwear it all the time.'
Ross:,"b' (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is\nsilver.'"
Rachel:,"b' Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. '"
Ross:,b' Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!'
Rachel:,b' Well isn\x92t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy\nand that I can get a lot of use out of?'
Ross:,b' What did you get?'
Rachel:,b' Credit. '
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' How do ya do.'
Joey:,b' He\x92s doin\x92 some thinkin\x92!'
Chandler:,b' What happened? What happened?!'
Joey:,b' You kissed my girlfriend!'
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, I like those sunglasses.'"
Ross:,"b' Like \x91em, like \x91em? Or, I\x92d like to get store credit for\nthat amount like \x91em?'"
Rachel:,"b' (Swears in Italian, it\x92s the same term used by Joey earlier and\nJoey nods his approval.)'"
Rachel:,b' Fancy soap? I thought we were savin\x92 that for the Pope!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you\ncan actually use the phrase, ""That\x92s not how your dad used to do it.""'"
Rachel:,b' (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I\x92ll get it. (goes over to the door.)'"
Chandler:,b' Gotcha! (laughs)'
Joey:,b' That doesn\x92t sound like thinking to me!'
Chandler:,b' Sorry!'
Joey:,b' Y\x92know I don\x92t think you should be talking at all in there! I\nthink you\x92ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, okay, you got it!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, can you pass me the yams?'"
Ross:,"b' Sure! Oh, and Joey\x92s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange\nthem.'"
Rachel:,b' Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!'
Ross:,"b' There\x92s nothing the matter with me. See, I\x92m not completely\ndevoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)'"
Chandler:,"b' You can\x92t tell, but I\x92m trying to break the tension by\nmooning you guys!'"
Joey:,"b' All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,\nall right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn\x92t mean anything to you, then\nyou should get out of there, otherwise you\x92re just an idiot in a box!'"
Chandler:,"b' You\x92re right, and I\x92m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want\nyou to be my friend again! I swear, I won\x92t say another word tonight.'"
Joey:,b' So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?'
Chandler:,b' Absolutely!'
Joey:,b' That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?\n(There\x92s no response from Chandler.) Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' Don\x92t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross\nwhat\x92s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell\nfrom the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the\nmuseum from the first time we\x85 were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,\nbut I keep the things that matter! '"
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know what to say, I\x92m sorry. Though, you\x92re not\nsupposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It\x92s like a million years old, we, we\nactually, we had people looking for that.'"
Joey:,b' I\x92ll get it. (It\x92s Kathy.)'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' That\x92s okay. Chandler\x92s the one I\x92m mad at.'
Joey:,b' In the box.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, he-he can\x92t talk right now.'"
Phoebe:,b' He\x92s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, had reasons. '"
Phoebe:,b' They were threefold.'
Joey:,b' (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Joey:,"b' He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get\nout of there!'"
Chandler:,b' So?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, we\x92re gonna be fine! Get out!'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, you did some real good thinkin\x92 in there.'"
Chandler:,"b' Man, this is\x85 '"
Joey:,b' Now go! \x91Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from\nyou\x92re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.) '
Joey:,"b' All right, who got Chandler? \x91Cause I uh, need to trade.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, he sees her!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, she sees him! Oh, they\x92re hugging!'"
Ross:,b' He\x92s taking her purse!'
Joey:,"b' Uhh, that\x92s not them. I\x92m gonna go call the police.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, there they are!'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, get a room.'"
