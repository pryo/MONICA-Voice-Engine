Joey:,"b' Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up\nto twice their size and never go back.'"
Rachel:,b' (looking at her fingers) Oh my\x85God! Let me see that! (Grabs the\nbook from him.)'
Joey:,b' (laughing) You fall for it every time!'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'

Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows?\n(There\x92s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby\x92s born, they\x92re\n'"

Rachel:,b' Oh that\x92s nice.'
Joey:,b' I just want you to say it once in a while.'
Joey:,b' What?!'
Joey:,b' Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,"b' Turkey\x92s are beautiful, intelligent animals!'"
Joey:,b' No they\x92re not! They\x92re ugly and stupid and delicious!'
Joey:,b' She is?'
Rachel:,b' Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast\nchicken?'
Joey:,b' Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and\nmade it walk across the table.'
Joey:,"b' But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no\nturkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!'"
Joey:,b' No there won\x92t! I promise I will finish that turkey!'
Joey:,"b' That\x92s right! \x91Cause I\x92m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this\nis what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don\x92t read a\nlot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Happy Thanksgiving!'
Phoebe:,b' Anything I can do to help?'
Phoebe:,b' Sure!'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To\nChandler) So how\x92s the game?'"
Chandler:,b' I have no idea.'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah! I\x92m just pretending to watch the game so I don\x92t have\nto help out with stuff.'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t believe you! That is\x85brilliant! And Monica has no\nidea?'
Chandler:,b' Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV. '
Chandler:,b' Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There\x92s no\nAnderson.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don\x92t think I can help\nyou after all, I didn\x92t realize '"
Phoebe:,"b' Well normally I don\x92t, but y\x92know\x85(looks at the\nTV)\x85Green Bay is playing.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well it\x92s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it\x92s not bad.\nIt just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to\nJune. '"
Chandler:,"b' Oh hey. I\x92d shake your hand but uh; I\x92m really into the\ngame. Plus, I think it\x92d be better for my ego if we didn\x92t stand right next to\neach other.'"
Phoebe:,b' (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well\ndone.'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m watching the game, but I\x92m not deaf!'"
Chandler:,"b' (To Phoebe) Y\x92know, it\x92s been a while since we\x92ve\nscreamed something. Maybe we should.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh okay.'
Chandler:,b' Oh come on!'
Phoebe:,b' Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!'
Joey:,b' Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach\nfirst. Eatin\x92 chips is like stretching.'
Joey:,"b' Don\x92t worry, Tribbianis never get full.'"
Joey:,b' (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?'
Joey:,b' Oh hey!'
Ross:,b' (entering) Will!'
Ross:,b' Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross\nrealizes what he said.) Hot stuff?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?'"
Ross:,b' Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.'
Ross:,"b' Oh! Man I don\x92t think I\x92ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis\x92\ngraduation party.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. It would\x92ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' (laughs) Yeah.'
Ross:,b' So how long are you in town?'
Rachel:,"b' (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi! '"
Ross:,"b' Aw\x97oh, that\x92s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?'"
Ross:,"b' Will, high school was-was a long time ago.'"
Rachel:,"b' (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He\'s really got that sexy, smoldering\nthing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he\x92s\x85 Look\nat the way he\x92s just staring at me. I think he\x92s trying to mouth something to\nme, but I can\x92t make it out. (Will mouths, ""I hate you."")'"
Chandler:,b' Good game!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.'
Phoebe:,b' (simultaneously) Green Bay.'
Chandler:,b' (simultaneously) Detroit.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green\nBay\x85Mermen.'"
Rachel:,"b' Hi! Will, right?'"
Rachel:,b' Hi! I\x92m Rachel Green.'
Rachel:,"b' Really?! Aren\x92t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am\nhaving the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at\nLance Davis\x92 graduation party?'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you!'
Joey:,b' That\x92s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At\nleast give me a challenge!'
Joey:,b' (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?'
Joey:,b' (To Rachel) It\x92s like me when I was born.'
Rachel:,"b' All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?'"
Rachel:,b' What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y\x92know what? Can\nwe please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?\nThe smell is just yuck!'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m sorry. What?'
Joey:,"b' (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?'"
Rachel:,"b' Umm, I\x92m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?'"
Phoebe:,b' I think you do.'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m-I\x92m\x97I had no idea. I\x92m sorry. I\x85'
Rachel:,"b' Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I\x92m real sorry for whatever\nI-I did to you in high school\x85'"
Rachel:,b' You had a club?!'
Rachel:,"b' Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who\nelse was in this club?'"
Ross:,"b' No need to point, she knows who Ross is.'"
Rachel:,b' (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?'
Ross:,b' No. No.'
Rachel:,b' So who else was in this club?'
Ross:,"b' Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but\nI-I don\x92t think he-he knew what it was.'"
Rachel:,"b' So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an\nI Hate Rachel club.'"
Ross:,b' That was in high school! It\x92s not like it was binding forever.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay Monica, did you know about this?!'"
Ross:,"b' Look Rach I-I\x92m sorry, okay? I\x85I was a stupid kid, okay? The\nonly reason I joined\x85'"
Ross:,b' \x85co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love\nwith you. Obviously I didn\x92t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I\nHate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.'
Rachel:,b' Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say\nmean things about me?'
Ross:,b' No-no! No-no. No-no.'
Phoebe:,b' What?! What else did you do?'
Rachel:,b' What rumor?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!'"
Rachel:,b' Ross!'
Ross:,b' It was no big deal. We-we\x85said that the rumor was\x85that\numm\x85you had both\x85male and female reproductive parts.'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,b' (shocked) Oh my God!'
Rachel:,b' What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)'
Chandler:,b' Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite\ncheerleader from Long Island?!'
Rachel:,b' Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This\nis why Adam Carter wouldn\x92t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay\nin this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)'
Ross:,"b' Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one\x92s not really our\nfault.'"
Rachel:,"b' Monica, how come you never told me this?!'"
Rachel:,b' Joey stop staring! There\x92s nothing there! It\x92s not true!'
Joey:,b' I\x92m afraid I\x92m gonna need proof.'
Rachel:,b' Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)'
Joey:,b' You are my Everest.'
Joey:,"b' Oh yes I do. Otherwise what\x92s next? Today I\x92m just a guy who\ncan\x92t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I\x92m the guy who eats half a '"
Rachel:,"b' (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote\nin my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you\x92re such a good person."" Not\ngirl! Person!'"
Ross:,"b' Rach, I think you\x92re reading a little too much into it.'"
Rachel:,"b' (reading what he wrote again) ""Dear Rach, you\x92re a great\nperson. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."" (Will laughs.)'"
Ross:,"b' Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the\nentire school and tell them it wasn\x92t true?!'"
Rachel:,b' Yes!'
Ross:,b' Well look-look I\x92m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million\nyears ago!'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half\nand half! Y\x92know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in\nhigh school.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!'
Ross:,b' No.'
Rachel:,b' Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a\n50-year-old woman?'
Ross:,b' Hey! She didn\x92t look 50!'
Chandler:,b' Did she look 16?'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, there\x92s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh! (They all look.) Wow!'
Ross:,b' She didn\x92t photograph well!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, she probably wasn\x92t familiar with the process having spent\nmost of her life sitting for oil paintings!'"
Phoebe:,"b' So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird\ndinner?'"
Ross:,"b' I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of\nus. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must\nknow, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace\x85'"
Ross:,b' Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can\x92t believe you-you told\npeople about this?! Everybody knew?! Y\x92know what? (To Will) I\x92m back in the\nclub!'
Phoebe:,b' I wanna join!'
Rachel:,b' Wh\x97Phoebe!!'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry. I\x92m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I\ndidn\x92t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn\nFrench. Bonjour.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, y\x92know\x97Fine! You guys have your stupid little club,\nbut I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!\nYou gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)'"
Rachel:,b' Wow\x85'
Ross:,b' As a romancer of the elderly.'
Ross:,b' The eyes\x85did still sparkle.'
Rachel:,b' She\x92s right.'
Ross:,b' Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Nope.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It\x92s exactly how I\x92d imagined\nit would be.'
Joey:,"b' (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right\nwhere\x92s that turkey!'"
Phoebe:,b' Joey! Those are my maternity pants!'
Joey:,b' Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!'
Joey:,b' Well that\x92s it. I\x92m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come\nthe meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.'"
Phoebe:,b' Is there anything we can do for you?'
Joey:,"b' No just, nobody press on my stomach.'"
Rachel:,b' You can keep those pants by the way.'
Joey:,b' Whoa\x97hey\x97wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?'
Joey:,"b' Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)\nA little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the\nknife again.) What?! Are you afraid you\x92re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!'"
