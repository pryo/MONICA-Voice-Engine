Ross:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys?\nThought I\x92d take that bad boy out for a little spin.'"
Rachel:,b' Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let '
Ross:,b' It\x92s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin\x92 good. When do I get to take\nthat baby out again?'"
Rachel:,b' (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it\nall the time.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! I can\x92t believe you lied to me.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about\nis the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)'"
Ross:,b' Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I\x92ll be glad\nto take you for a quick spin around the block.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, you got a couple hours?'"
Ross:,b' Whew! That was a brisk ride!'
Rachel:,b' Take the top down did ya?'
Ross:,b' Only way to fly.'
Rachel:,b' Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does '
Ross:,b' You\x92re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.'
Rachel:,"b' Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.'"
Ross:,b' Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must\x92ve seen me\ncruising in the bad boy.'
Rachel:,b' I think she\x92s checking out your beehive Ross.'
Ross:,b' What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.'
Rachel:,b' Gimme the keys!'
Ross:,b' No way!'
Rachel:,b' Well no brush!'
Ross:,"b' Fine! Y\x92know what? It doesn\x92t matter, because, if I remember\ncorrectly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. '"
Rachel:,b' (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)'
Chandler:,"b' Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that\x92s because I didn\x92t send him an\ninvitation.'"
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t even know the man. Okay? We\x92re not that close. I\nhaven\x92t seen him in years.'
Chandler:,"b' Well he doesn\x92t have to know! It\x92s not like we run in the\nsame circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.'"
Chandler:,"b' Trust me, you don\x92t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna\nbe staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!'"
Rachel:,b' My God!'
Ross:,b' What do you think you\x92re doing?!'

Rachel:,"b' Look Ross, if you\x92re so freaked out, just get in the car!'"
Ross:,b' With you?! Yeah right!'
Rachel:,b' All right. (She starts off.)'
Ross:,"b' (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)'"
Rachel:,b' What are you doing?! Get in the front!'
Ross:,b' In the death seat?!!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my\x85'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey sweetie!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica\x92s. I\x92ll be right\nback. (She goes to get it.)'"
Phoebe:,b' What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.\n(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)'
Joey:,b' So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?'
Joey:,"b' Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little\nbetter.'"
Joey:,"b' So uh, what\x92s your name?'"
Joey:,"b' Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?'"
Joey:,"b' Me too! There\x92s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?'"
Chandler:,b' What\x92s this?'
Chandler:,b' Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!\nNo more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers\x97Think of the money we\x92ll\nsave!! (Monica just looks at him.) We\x92re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our\nwedding be bigger please?'
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know we already went over this and I won!'
Chandler:,b' Look forget it okay? I don\x92t want to go. I don\x92t want to see\nhim. I don\x92t wanna.'
Chandler:,b' No-no '
Chandler:,b' He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi!'
Chandler:,b' Does it matter?!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah o-okay, but I\x92m just doing this for you.'"
Chandler:,b' So I really never get to win anymore?'
Joey:,b' Pheebs!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Listen, you know how uh, when you\x92re wearing pants and you lean\nforward I check out your underwear?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Well, when Jake did it I saw that\x85he was wearing women\x92s\nunderwear!'"
Phoebe:,b' I know. They were mine.'
Joey:,"b' Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that\x92s weird!'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, it\x92s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try\nthem on.'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s weird!'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m wearing his briefs right now.'
Joey:,b' That\x92s\x85kinda hot.'
Phoebe:,b' I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I wouldn\x92t know about that.'"
Phoebe:,b' And! Y\x92know what Jake says? That women\x92s underwear is actually\nmore comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah well next thing you know, he\x92ll be telling you that your high\nheels are good for his posture!'"
Phoebe:,b' There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I\x92m thinking\neven more than you.'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m just saying that only a man completely secure with his\nmasculinity could walk around in women\x92s underwear! I don\x92t think you could ever\ndo that.'
Joey:,b' Hey! I '
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, whatever.'"
Joey:,"b' You\x92ve seen my huge stack of porn, right? (Phoebe nods.)'"
Rachel:,b' God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have '
Ross:,b' (shocked) You don\x92t have a '
Rachel:,"b' Oh Ross you\x92re so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to\nrelax all right? Just need to relax\x85 (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)'"
Ross:,b' (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you\x97Okay\nthat\x92s not funny! Just stop horsing around!'
Rachel:,"b' I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around.'"
Rachel:,b' Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)'
Ross:,"b' Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that\nmuch trouble.'"
Rachel:,b' Really? You think so?'
Ross:,b' I was talking to myself! You\x92re going down!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)'"
Chandler:,"b' No! No! I don\x92t want him to know we\x92re here yet! I\x92m not\nsure I\x92m ready for that. And besides, he\x92s not gonna be too happy to see me\neither.'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know if I\x92ve told you this, but he\x92s kinda\ntried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, he\x92s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New\nYork, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y\x92know it\x92s all very '"
Chandler:,b' And there\x92s daddy!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I\x92ll\ngo under, you go over!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ll get right on that.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under\nhis leg.)'
Ross:,"b' No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I\x92m sure we won\x92t get arrested\nfor this.'"
Rachel:,"b' (sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?'"
Ross:,b' Oh my God.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yes, absolutely! Y\x92know, it\x92s weird uh, but I had a dream\nlast night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh\x85well I probably\nshouldn\x92t tell you the rest.'"
Rachel:,"b' (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oops sorry, my mistake.'"
Ross:,b' Dear Lord!!'
Ross:,b' Here it comes.'
Rachel:,"b' Really?! You think so? Y\x92know, I had just rolled out of bed.'"
Ross:,"b' Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!'"
Rachel:,b' Y\x92know you\x92re-you\x92re probably wondering about the old\ndate on there.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' I bet you\x92re a Gemini. '
Rachel:,b' Taurus?'
Rachel:,b' Virgo?'
Rachel:,b' Sagittarius?'
Rachel:,"b' I knew it! I knew it, ahh\x85.'"

Rachel:,b' I won\x92t speed.'
Rachel:,b' I promise.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,b' Oh well\x85'
Ross:,b' I can handle the stick!!'
Chandler:,"b' Believe me, I\x92ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.'
Chandler:,b' He\x92s coming into the audience. He\x92s coming into the\naudience.'
Chandler:,b' It can\x92t happen like this. Okay? I\x92ll meet you back at the\nhotel.'
Joey:,b' Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe\nthat he\x92s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.'
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know, I\x92m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh.'
Joey:,b' The silk? Feels really good!'
Phoebe:,b' Huh.'
Joey:,b' Yeah! And-and things aren\x92t as\x85smashed down as I thought they\nwere gonna be.'
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s great Joe!'
Joey:,b' Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with\nmen\x92s underwear!'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh.'
Joey:,"b' Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You\x92ve got cotton,\nsilk, lace! And y\x92know what I\x92ve always wondered about?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hmm?'
Joey:,b' Pantyhose! Y\x92know? The way they start at your toe and go all the way\nup to here\x85 (He mimed that and stops when he realizes he went too far.) I should go\ntake these off shouldn\x92t I?'
Phoebe:,b' I think it\x92s important that you do.'
Chandler:,b' (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, they\x92re a hoot.'"
Chandler:,b' Actually Monica and I are engaged.'
Chandler:,b' Wait! Wait! We\x92d really love it if you could be there.'
Chandler:,"b' I know it would make me happy, ma\x92am.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) When I was growing up I\x85played the one on the far\nleft.'
Rachel:,b' Remind me to introduce you to someone!'
Ross:,b' Who?'
Rachel:,b' Fourth gear!!'
Ross:,b' What?! What does he want?! I wasn\x92t doing anything!'
Rachel:,b' Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two\no\x92clock position.'
Ross:,b' Maybe it\x92s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!\n(They pull over.)'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s a different guy!'
Ross:,b' Good evening officer.'
Ross:,"b' Ah no. I don\x92t, but it could not have been more than sixty.'"
Ross:,b' I mean you\x92re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are\nya?'
Ross:,b' Y\x92know of-officer I uh\x85I had the weirdest dream last night\x85'

Rachel:,b' (pause) You have a son!'
Ross:,b' I know. I know.'
Phoebe:,b' Feel better?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I\x92m y\x92know insecure about my\nmanhood or anything y\x92know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right\nnow.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I understand.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and\ngoes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!'
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?'"
Joey:,b' Oh! Maybe it\x92s because I\x92m on television. I\x92m an actor on '
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' Hm-mmm.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with\nit. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.'"
