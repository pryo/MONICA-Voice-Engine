Phoebe:,"b' Umm listen, I don\x92t think\x85I don\x92t think I\x92m gonna\nmake it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay I can\x92t let you do this! She\x92s lying to you.'
Phoebe:,"b' She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs\nUrsula\x92s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay.\nYeah\x97Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.\n(Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here\x92s the nametag from the restaurant where she works\nas a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here\x92s her driver license, this\noughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I almost don\x92t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just\nremember I\x92m a minute younger.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No. You\x92re not, you\x92re not stupid.'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.\nJust\x85you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)'"
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s not so bad.'
Rachel:,"b' No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,\nI am just '"
Joey:,"b' Come on! You\x92re good with kids. They\x92re just crazy on Halloween.\nY\x92know, they\x92re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!'"
Rachel:,b' Really? You think that\x92s all it is? '
Joey:,"b' Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas\x85and their\nbirthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they\x92re hungry\nor sleepy. Y\x92know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Listen, I\x92ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I let him win\x97Ross!'"
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Chandler:,b' Would you tell her I let you win please?'

Chandler:,b' I am strong! I\x92ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)'
Chandler:,b' Oh what\x92s the matter? Are you scared?'
Chandler:,"b' Okay. 1\x852\x853\x97Go! (Once again he\x92s at a stalemate,\nbut this time he\x92s in pain.) (Pause) I\x92m gonna kill myself!'"
