Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' What are you guys doing up?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do\nyou know a six-letter word for red?'"
Joey:,b' (thinks) Dark red.'
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for\nyou later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?"""
Joey:,"b' Aww, you guys are so cute!'"
Joey:,"b"" All right, I'll see you in the morning."""
Rachel:,"b' (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.'"
Phoebe:,b' All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!\n(Donates it.) How much more do we need?'
Rachel:,b' A couple of bucks.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this\ncould take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh\nmy God, this is a police badge!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't\nserve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I\nthink I can come up with something better than that."""
Rachel:,"b"" Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm\nat the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy\nhas been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in\nhope.)"""
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey, you guys!'"
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey Joey!'
Joey:,"b' (To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?'"

Joey:,"b"" No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!"""
Joey:,"b"" No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the\nbathroom.)"""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was\nshot by a hunter."""
Rachel:,"b"" (disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!"""
Ross:,"b' (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don\'t know. (To the salesman who is hovering\nnearby) I\'m sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch\nthat says, ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says, (In a sexy voice) ""Come\nhere to me!""'"
Rachel:,b' What?! You say that to kids?!!'
Ross:,"b' No! No! No! The ""Come here to me"" is y\'know for the ladies.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch."""
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as\nthe couch!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!"""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and\nhands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the\ncouch.)"""
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting\nher to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?"""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!\nCome on! Come on!"""
Rachel:,"b' (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her\namazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!'"
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,"b"" Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the\nstore.)"""
Rachel:,b' Ross!'
Ross:,"b"" What's that supposed to mean?"""
Rachel:,b' Ross!'
Ross:,"b"" Not that it's any of your business, but we """
Ross:,b' Yeah! Rach?'
Rachel:,"b"" Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a\nvery heavy couch."""
Ross:,b' Then tell him quickly.'
Rachel:,b' (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.'
Ross:,"b' Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!'"
Rachel:,b' Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are '
Ross:,b' A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? """
Phoebe:,"b"" You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again."""
Phoebe:,b' Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book\n'em."""
Phoebe:,"b' Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you\napologize to the tree.'"
Phoebe:,b' You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The\nwoman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!'"
Ross:,b' Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)'
Rachel:,"b"" Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?"""
Ross:,"b"" Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."""
Ross:,"b' Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the\nrailing.)'"
Rachel:,"b"" Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!"""
Ross:,"b' Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!\nYou can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.\nYou got it?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Good-good-good. '
Rachel:,b' Oh-oh! '
Ross:,"b' Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? '"
Rachel:,b' Any chance you think the couch looks good there?'
Phoebe:,"b"" \x85so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.\n(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds."""
Chandler:,"b' Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could\nget arrested.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at\nher.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for\nthe door just as Joey enters.)"""
Phoebe:,b' (To Joey) Hey.'
Joey:,"b"" (To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh."""
Chandler:,"b' Hi, Joe.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I didn\x92t know you guys were going to be here.'"
Joey:,b' (backing away) What?! Why?!'
Joey:,b' Nothing!'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!"""
Joey:,"b"" All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't\nwant to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)"""
Chandler:,b' Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said\nthat? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I\ndon\x92t want to talk about it.'
Joey:,"b' Well, it involved Monica.'"
Chandler:,"b"" You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!\n(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.\n(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I\nlove you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)"""
Joey:,"b"" Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt\nabout her like that since I found out about you two--ish. """
Joey:,"b' Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and '"
Joey:,b' It-it doesn\x92t?'
Chandler:,"b"" No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous\nbecause I've become the apartment stud."""
Joey:,b' That kinda sounds like your dream dude.'
Joey:,b' In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.'
Chandler:,"b' Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are\nyou attracted to her?'"
Joey:,b' (looks at her) Not really.'
Chandler:,b' Well there you have it!'
Joey:,"b"" No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I\nmean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but\ny'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Well y'know, Monica and I were """

Phoebe:,"b"" Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're\nblocking the entrance. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause\nI'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park\nanywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.\n10-4. (Tries to leave.)"""
