Rachel:,b' Ohh\x85'
Joey:,b' That sounds perfect!'
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' You\x92re gonna mess it up let me do it.'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m not gonna mess it up.'

Chandler:,"b' Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn\x92t agree to that!'"
Ross:,b' I don\x92t know.'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, you are 12 years older than her.'"
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?'"
Ross:,"b' Uh-uh\x97Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had\nno idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age\ndifference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it\ndoesn\x92t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I\x92m the one dating\nElizabeth, not you!'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)'
Rachel:,"b' See? Now, he could date her.'"
Chandler:,b' Will you marry me? '
Joey:,b' It\x92s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!'

Phoebe:,"b' No, I know what a silent is I meant, what\x92s going on with your\nhair?'"
Rachel:,"b' (suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?'"
Phoebe:,b' No! It\x92s nice!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, hi!'"
Rachel:,"b' Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is\nMr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He\x92s the head of my department.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)'"

Ross:,b' (screaming) Everybody '
Rachel:,b' Ugh! So close!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey you guys! Look! '
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' I got me some drinks!'
Rachel:,b' What are you doing?'
Phoebe:,b' Open bar!'
Rachel:,b' Well now it\x92s an empty bar.'
Phoebe:,b' You just can\x92t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can\x92t\nyou?'
Joey:,b' I won! That was my guess!'
Rachel:,b' What?! What?! What?!'
Joey:,"b' I guessed 20,000!'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey! It is an auction! You don\x92t guess, you buy!'"
Joey:,"b' What?! I don\x92t have 20,000!'"
Rachel:,b' Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)'
Phoebe:,b' Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding\nagain. Joey waves and does a salute.] '
Chandler:,"b' (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under\nGod. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It\x92s a\nbutchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign\nfriends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.) '"
Chandler:,b' Yes! Yes! I\x92m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is\neverything\x97are you\x97are you perrr-perfect?!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you\ncan\x92t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were\ngoing to be cold, you should\x92ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are\nyou okay? Are you okay?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes! I\x92m fine. In fact I\x92ve been fine for a long time now\nand I think, the reason is you.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I\ncouldn\x92t imagine growing old with\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let\nme say it.'"
Chandler:,"b' What?! I\x92m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler\nturns and looks) Oh, that\x92s Richard!'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don\x92t know why I did\nthat!'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Richard\x92s date) And uh, you don\x92t have a mustache which\nis good. (She just smiles.) I\x92m Chandler; I make jokes when I\x92m uncomfortable.'"
Chandler:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,"b' Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at\nhim.) See I, did it again.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)'"
Chandler:,b' Yes. (Thinking he\x92s gone.)'
Rachel:,b' '
Joey:,b' I didn\x92t know it was an auction!'
Rachel:,b' Wh?!'
Joey:,"b' I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!'"
Rachel:,b' Why would a charity give away a free boat?!'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know! Charity?'
Rachel:,b' Ugh!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, just buy the damn boat! (She\x92s still working her way through\nher tray of booze.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, don\x92t you think you\x92ve had enough to drink?'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m just helping the kids!'
Rachel:,b' How is you drinking helping the kids?'
Phoebe:,"b' Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.'"
Joey:,b' Oh hi!'
Joey:,"b' Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?'"
Joey:,"b' (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad\nnews. Umm, I can\x92t buy the boat, I don\x92t have any money.'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)'"
Joey:,"b' So uh listen, I think I\x92m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (stopping him) Hey! You\x85can\x92t\x85leave Joey! You agreed to\nbuy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna\nkill me!'"
Joey:,"b' Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don\x92t have that kind of money!'"
Rachel:,"b' I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All\nright, this is what we\x92re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and\nwe are just gonna let them buy it, and then you\x92re just gonna pay the difference.'"
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Look, I don\x92t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!\nY\x92know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!'"
Rachel:,b' Not great.'
Chandler:,"b' I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my\nparents making love to the same guy.'"
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' Oh my God, you guys!! (He\x92s excited about what he thought happened.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we\ngot a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!'"
Ross:,b' Who?'
Chandler:,b' Richard!'
Ross:,b' What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that\x92s right that\x92s\nright. That\x92s Richard\x92s favorite place too.'
Chandler:,b' Oh you knew that. Good!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, maybe she is too young for me. Y\x92know, when I was over\nthere and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I\nfinally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don\x92t know what to do.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I\x92m-I\x92m 12 years older than she is.'"
Ross:,b' Hmm.'
Chandler:,b' For cam'
Ross:,"b' Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she\x92s-she\x92s sweet and pretty\nand\x85'"
Ross:,"b' No! No! I\x85didn\x92t do that. It\x92s just\x85 Okay, honestly\nno. I don\x92t, I don\x92t see a big future with her.'"
Ross:,"b' I\x92ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you\x92re not\ncareful you may not get married at '"
Joey:,"b' Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh great!'
Joey:,b' (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay.'"
Rachel:,b' (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?'
Phoebe:,"b' It\x92s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type\nthingy she\x92s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)\nExcuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only\nshakes it.) '"
Joey:,"b' Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?'"
Joey:,"b' Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the\ntalking.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day\nsailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.'"
Joey:,b' You-you have to pay that! It\x92s not just a guess.'
Rachel:,b' (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)'
Rachel:,b' Ohh\x85'
Joey:,b' Are you kidding me?! She\x92s gonna this boat!'
Rachel:,b' Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife\x92s name?'
Rachel:,"b' Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, ""The Pam.""'"
Joey:,b' Aw-awww!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, uh-uh imagine this, ""The Mr. Bowmont.""'"
Joey:,b' Oooooh\x85'
Rachel:,"b' Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to\nhim.) All right, you are settin\x92 sail up the Hudson! You\x92ve got the wind in your\nh\x97(sees that he\x92s bald)\x97arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that\nyou\x92ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin\x92! You\ncan\x97ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and\nthen when you\x92re old, Cappy.'"
Joey:,b' No way! It\x92s mine!!'
Rachel:,b' (To Joey) What?! What?!'
Joey:,b' All that stuff you just said? I want that!'
Rachel:,"b' But Joey you don\x92t have $20,000!'"
Joey:,"b' Who cares?! I-I\x92ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.\nBowmont!!'"
Joey:,"b' Oh my God, you\x92re back!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically\ntrying to wave them off.)'"
Phoebe:,b' I wanna see what\x92s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. '
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Eww! Oh, it\x92s all dirty. You should throw this out.'"
Chandler:,b' (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!'
Phoebe:,b' What happened?'
Chandler:,b' Richard was there so I couldn\x92t do it!'
Joey:,b' What?! Noooo\x85 (Phoebe gasps.)'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m gonna do it tomorrow y\x92know, and-and surprise her, but\nnow you\x92ve ruined it!'"
Joey:,b' We didn\x92t ruin it!'
Chandler:,b' Who walks into a room and asks to see a person\x92s hands?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor\x85'"
Joey:,b' '
Phoebe:,b' Good one! Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' This is terrible. What am I going to do?'
Phoebe:,"b' Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn\x92t know for sure,\nso just throw her off the track.'"
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage\nis the last thing on my mind.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you\x92re scared of commitment!\nConvince her that you\x92re a little coward!'
Chandler:,"b' I can do that, I\x92ve had 30 years of practice.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)'"
Joey:,b' That guy\x92s still doing that?!'
Rachel:,"b' (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God\nyou\x92re here, let me see your hand!!'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, you\x92re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!'"
Ross:,b' (in his head) '
Ross:,"b' Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about\x85'"
Ross:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, break-up\x92s still on!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I\nlook? Do I look like a guy who doesn\x92t want to get married?'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each\nother.) I never noticed that before.'"
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, just hanging out, talkin\x92 about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)\nYeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it\nis and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.'"
Joey:,"b' (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, well\x85 Y\x92know, it just got me thinking though, why\nwould anybody ever want to get married huh?'"
Chandler:,b' Eh\x85'
Joey:,b' (all excited) The Mr. Bowmont\x92s here!!! (Jumps over the back off the\ncouch and runs out into the street.)'
Rachel:,"b' Isn\x92t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin\x92 married.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I know, they\x92re gonna be '"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh\x85 I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that\nhappen?'"
Phoebe:,b' '
Rachel:,b' No! I\x92m so happy for them!'
Phoebe:,b' Me too! So happy for them!'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m so happy and not at all jealous.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!'"
Rachel:,"b' I mean I\x92m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean\nwhat\x92s 2%? That\x92s nothing.'"
Phoebe:,b' Totally. I\x92m like 90/10.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah me too.'
Joey:,"b' Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?'"
Rachel:,"b' (staring at him) Wh\x97no, but y\x92know who did stop in here\nlooking for ya, Tennille.'"
Chandler:,"b' Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is\nunnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let\x92s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs\ndon\x92t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a\nlifetime, and that\x92s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that\x92s good at sports!'"
Chandler:,"b' If marriage worked, I\x92d be all for it. But do you know what the\ndivorce rate in this country is? 97%.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, never say never but y\x92know probably uh yeah, never.'"
Chandler:,b' Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of\nstrategy? Why don\x92t you put down your copy of \x91The Rules\x92 huh mantrap?!'
Chandler:,"b' (to them) It\x92s okay, I got a plan.'"
Rachel:,b' We\x92re gonna find love!'
Phoebe:,b' Definitely!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m pretty confident about that. That\x92s what makes it so\neasy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little\nguarantee though.'"
Phoebe:,b' What do you mean?'
Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither\nof them are married by the time they\x92re 40, they marry each other.'"
Phoebe:,b' You mean a backup?'
Rachel:,b' Exactly!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, yeah I got that.'"
Rachel:,b' You do?'
Phoebe:,b' Hm-mmm.'
Rachel:,b' Who?'
Phoebe:,b' Joey.'
Rachel:,b' Joey?!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,b' Are you serious?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I locked him years ago!'"
Rachel:,"b' Wh\x85 So\x85 If neither of you are married by the time you\x92re\n40, you\x92re gonna marry Joey.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to\nseal the deal.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, seriously?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were\x85 (She makes two clicking\nsounds with her tongue and purrs.)'"
Rachel:,b' Charming.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well hey, it\x92s just a backup.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' Hey Monica!'
Joey:,"b' This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa, what\x92s the matter?! Talk to the captain!'"
Joey:,b' Chandler giving you a hard time huh?'
Joey:,"b' Well, you know Chandler.'"
Joey:,b' Maybe you changed?'
Joey:,b' Maybe that\x92s the problem.'
Joey:,"b' Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know! (All excited) I haven\x92t totally decided how to\ntalk on my boat yet.'
Joey:,"b' Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!'"
Joey:,b' There are?'
Joey:,b' R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and\nChandler\x92s tellin\x92 ya how much he hates marriage?!'
Joey:,b' Chandler '
Joey:,b' You got '
Ross:,b' What happened you guys?'
Ross:,b' Rach!'
Rachel:,b' Hey you!'
Ross:,"b' Hey, come on in.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh thank you. Hey y\x92know, I\x92m so sorry to hear about you and\nElizabeth.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we\x92d be able to make it work, but\nuh, I guess it just wasn\x92t meant to be.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, love. It\x92s a tricky business isn\x92t it?'"
Ross:,b' I guess so.'
Rachel:,"b' So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the\ntime we\x92re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and\nwe\x92ve-we\x92ve already slept together so y\x92know there\x92ll be no surprises\nthere! You know what I mean? No like, ""What\x92s that?!""'"
Ross:,b' Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.'
Rachel:,b' Exactly.'
Ross:,"b' Ohh, yeah I already have one.'"
Rachel:,b' What? Who?'
Ross:,b' Phoebe.'
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe?! Wait a\x97but-but she just, she said that Joey was her\nbackup.'"
Ross:,"b' Ohh, I don\x92t think so.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey\nmade a deal!'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s impossible! I mean '
Joey:,b' Where the hell have you been?!'
Chandler:,b' I was making a coconut phone with the professor.'
Joey:,b' Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Yeah, I\x92ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with\nher and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn\x92t keep\nflying off!'"
Chandler:,b' My\x97Oh my God!'
Joey:,b' I know! They suck!!'
Chandler:,b' He\x92s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I\x92m\nsupposed to do that!'
Joey:,b' I know!'
Chandler:,b' Well what\x85 Y\x92know what I\x92m gonna do? I\x92m gonna go\nover there; I\x92m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!'
Joey:,"b' Look, Chandler I don\x92t think us getting our asses kicked is a\nsolution. Okay? Just '"
Chandler:,b' You\x92re right.'
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I\x92m gonna get the ring!\nI\x92m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I\x92m gonna go find her and (starts running for\nthe door) I\x92m just going to propose!'
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,b' Okay great.'
Joey:,b' Dude-dude-dude!'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
