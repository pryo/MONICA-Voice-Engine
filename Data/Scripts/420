Joey:,"b' Yeah, Rach, I think you\x92re handling that really well.'"
Rachel:,"b' Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There\x92s nothing to\nhandle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn\x92t for me and Joshua.\nY\x92know, they\x92re not gonna get married anyway!'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it\x92s ridiculous! I\nmean, they\x92re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way,\none of them is gonna realise what they\x92ve done and they\x92re call the whole thing\noff. I\x92m telling ya, you\x92re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you\x92re\ndancing at there\x92s.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, well, I don\x92t dance at weddings.'"

Ross:,"b' Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place\nthat her parents got married, but it\x92s going to be torn down, so\x85 I mean, I-I\nknow it\x92s crazy, but everything up \x91til now has been so crazy, and I don\x92t\nknow, this just feels right. Y\x92know?'"
Joey:,b' (still looking in date book) Hey! That\x92s the day after I stop\nmenstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn\x92t mine.'

Rachel:,"b' Well, yeah, right, y\x92know what? Yeah, you\x92re right, I mean, we\nno, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)\x85\x85I mean, I mean\nlike '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I know, I know, it\x92s-it\x92s so, it\x92s so totally like,\n""Whoa! Can we do this?"" Y\x92know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!\nDon\x92t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don\x92t you think?'"
Joey:,b' Joey Tribbiani.'
Chandler:,b' (answering for him) Yes he did.'
Chandler:,"b' (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!'"
Joey:,"b' (sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you\ndoin\x92?'"
Joey:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,"b' You\x92re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a\nstack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.)\nI\x92m Chandler.'"
Chandler:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,b' You mind if I\x85'
Chandler:,"b' So uh, what are you in for?'"
Chandler:,"b' What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.'"
Joey:,b' (asleep) So why don\x92t you give me your number?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' (catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)'
Phoebe:,b' Thank you!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m not gonna right to you! That\x92s not real!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I think we are.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, at least you didn\x92t '"
Phoebe:,b' Me too.'
Phoebe:,b' Me too.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Yay!'
Phoebe:,b' I '
Phoebe:,b' I guess.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! '
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, you\x92re such a cheater!'"
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hello! Little ones.'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They\x92re\nstunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, how\x92d that happen?'"
Chandler:,b' Because I\x92m cooler.'
Chandler:,"b' Well she\x92s, she\x92s the kinda girl\x97Joey was unconscious. '"
Joey:,b' (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What\x92s happening?'
Phoebe:,b' What is that?'
Joey:,"b' (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it\x92s gonna\nhelp me not to snore.'"
Joey:,b' (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don\x92t have too! It tastes good.\n(Puts it back in.)'
Chandler:,"b' Plus, you look cool.'"
Rachel:,"b' (entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, how did it go?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I did my best to convince him that I\x92m not some crazy girl\nwho is dying to get married\x97I\x92m just going through a hard time.'"
Phoebe:,b' What did he say?'
Rachel:,"b' Well uh, his answering machine was '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, maybe, but I don\x92t think I even care. I don\x92t think\nhe\x92s the one I\x92m sad about. Y\x92know, I know that I said that I am totally\nokay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don\x92t think I\x92m handling\nit all that well.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, maybe.'"
Rachel:,b' And I-I am just trying to figure out why.'
Phoebe:,b' Any luck?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, yeah, y\x92know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on\nagain, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on\nagain.'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Ross:,"b' So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,\nErnie\x92s at 9 o\x92clock?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, see I-I don\x92t know if we\x92re gonna be hungry at three.'"
Rachel:,b' Three people. Joshua\x92s not gonna be there.'
Ross:,b' What happened?'
Rachel:,"b' Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.'"
Ross:,b' Noo. Why?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, apparently he scares easy.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, Rachel, I\x92m-I\x92m sorry.'"
Rachel:,"b' It\x92s okay. Sometimes, things don\x92t work out the way you\x92d\nthought they would.'"
Ross:,b' Come here.'
Rachel:,"b' (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don\x92t you have to go pick up Emily?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah. '
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' You okay?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah! I got my girls.'
Rachel:,b' Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe\x92s lap.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (looks at Monica) Hey, y\x92know what might cheer you up?'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m not gonna marry Chandler!'
Phoebe:,b' Not after this!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she\ndoes, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it\x92s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the\ndoor.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that\noughta do it.'"
Joey:,b' (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am '
