Joey:,b' Yeah you are baby.'
Rachel:,b' So did they call you to tell you your name\x92s gonna be in this?'
Joey:,"b' No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,\nbut I said no.'"
Ross:,b' Why\x92d you say no?'
Joey:,"b' Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I\nwrite a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down\nthe elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.'"
Chandler:,b' If '
Rachel:,"b' Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus\ny\x92know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And\nif you do the interview you can mention, oh I don\x92t know, gal pal Rachel Green?'"
Chandler:,b' Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, don\x92t listen to him. Please?'"
Joey:,"b' Fine! All right, I\x92ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next\ntable so you can stop me if I y\x92know, start to say something stupid.'"

Joey:,"b' Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, we\x92re just four people with neck problems. You talk like\nthis. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)'"
Joey:,"b' (laughs) Actually, I didn\x92t know the magazine was paying for it.\nWouldn\x92t have mattered, I\x92m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.'"
Joey:,b' And I\x92ll have all the muffins.'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'

Joey:,"b' (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts\nto poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I guess it is. And so\x85 I\x92m gonna get on this\nspaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with\nflashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I\x92m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search\nof alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you\x92ll be long gone. But\nI won\x92t have aged at all.

Joey:,"b"" Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I\ncan't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do\x85so I just watch 'em\nhave sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) """
Chandler:,b' Nice work my friend.'
Joey:,"b"" Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's\nbutt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am\x85"""
Joey:,"b' Well, there are so many things, it\x92s hard to pick just one.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?'"

Phoebe:,b' (interrupting him) I was just being polite!'
Joey:,b' (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he\x92s got a\nbigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way\njackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?'
Rachel:,b' That '
Joey:,b' What are they doing out here? The coast\x92s all the way over there.\n(Points to the coast.)'

Joey:,b' (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo\x97you trying to kill me?!'

Ross:,"b"" (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's\nfun!"""
Chandler:,"b"" All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a\nbonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?"""
Joey:,"b' Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know what, we have to turn off the porn.'"
Joey:,b' I think you\x92re right.'
Chandler:,"b' All right, ready?'"
Joey:,b' One.'
Chandler:,b' Two.'
Joey:,b' That\x92s kinda nice.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s kinda a relief.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' You wanna see if we still have it?'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' FREE PORN!!!'

Joey:,"b' In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I\x92m also a mento for\nthe kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y\x92know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites\nhis fist to keep from talking.)'"
Joey:,b' Right.'
Joey:,"b' Matter of fact, I do.'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.'"
Joey:,"b"" Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping\nit, for like an hour?"""
Ross:,b' Are you serious?!'
Joey:,"b"" Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say\nanything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it."""
Ross:,b' Wow! We are pretty good at this!'
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!'
Joey:,"b"" Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks\nhis pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"""
Chandler:,b' What\x92s wrong with you?'
Joey:,"b' Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was\nlifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven\x92t been able to stand up\nsince. But um, I don\x92t think it\x92s anything serious.'"
Chandler:,b' This sounds like a hernia. You have to\x97you-you\x97Go to the\ndoctor!'
Joey:,"b' No way! \x91Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything\nit\x92s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows\nChandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.)\nDamn you 15s!'"
Rachel:,"b' It\x92s a trifle. It\x92s got all of these layers. First\nthere\x92s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from\nscratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then\nbeef saut\xe9ed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something\x92s wrong.] then\na little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!'"
Ross:,b' It tastes like feet!'
Joey:,b' I like it.'
Ross:,b' Are you kidding?'
Joey:,b' What\x92s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.'
Joey:,"b' The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,\nlimes\x97Hey, what was in that brown jar?'"

Rachel:,"b' Hey, come on now!'"
Joey:,"b' (pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin\x92? (Starts digging\nin.)'"
Joey:,"b' Uhh, I don\x92t believe in these crazy diets y\x92know, just\neverything in moderation.'"
Joey:,b' I\x92ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.'
Joey:,"b' It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn\x92t\nhave said. But believe me, that\x92s not gonna happen today.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I said that I\x85 (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)'"
Joey:,"b' You guys, this is Shelley, she\x92s interviewing me for '"
Rachel:,"b' (interrupting him) Hi! I\x92m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want\nthe dirt, I\x92m the one you come too. This might be Joey\x92s baby (rubbing her\nstomach), who knows? I\x92m just kidding\x97Seriously, (leans into the cassette\nrecorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.'"
Ross:,b' (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her\nunborn child.'

Chandler:,b' Thanks.'
Joey:,b' How come you have two?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Joey! Sorry!'"
Joey:,b' No that\x92s all right. Don\x92t worry about it.'
Rachel:,b' Oh but look! That\x92s gonna leave a stain! '
Joey:,b' Rach! Hey! It\x92s fine! You\x92re at Joey\x92s!'
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Joey:,b' Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)'
Rachel:,b' I\x92ve never lived like this before.'
Joey:,b' I know.'
Joey:,"b' All right, don\x92t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and\neats it.)'"
Ross:,"b"" All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna\nbe a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes\n(kisses Joey)."""
Joey:,"b"" Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I\ndidn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."""
Joey:,"b"" All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.\n(He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the\nchicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from\nmoving.)"""
Phoebe:,b' Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!'
Joey:,"b' Judge rules, no violation.'"
Phoebe:,b' Ohhh.'
Joey:,b' And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!'
Phoebe:,"b"" (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's\njust an old Wonton!"""
Joey:,"b' Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, tough call.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' I\x92d seen this thing on '
Ross:,b' Wait a minute! I saw that! On '
Joey:,"b' That\x92s right I stepped up! She\x92s my friend and she needed\nhelp! And if I had too, I\x92d pee on anyone of you!'"
Joey:,"b' Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.'"
Joey:,b' Really? Me? Wow! I don\x92t even know any huge gay people!'
Chandler:,b' It hurts me. It physically hurts me.'
Joey:,"b"" What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just\nlooked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your\nstuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"""
Ross:,b' Your make-up!'
Ross:,b' Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we\x92re face to\nface or-or should I climb down your back so we\x92re-we\x92re butt to face.'
Joey:,b' I think face to face.'
Ross:,b' I would say that.'
Joey:,"b' Face to face, yeah!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, here I go.'"
Joey:,b' All right. '
Joey:,b' (grunting) Oh my\x85 How much do you weigh Ross?!'
Ross:,"b' I prefer not to answer that right now, I\x92m still carrying a little\nholiday weight.'"
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know, when we talked about face to face, I don\x92t think we\nthought it all the way through.'"
Joey:,b' Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe\nthat he\x92s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.'
Chandler:,b' You\x92re turning into a woman.'
Joey:,b' No I\x92m not. Why would you say that? That\x92s just mean.'
Chandler:,b' Now I\x92ve upset you? What did I say?'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s not what you said. It\x92s the way you said it\x85 Oh My\nGod, I\x92m a woman!!!'"
Joey:,b' Great nap.'
Ross:,b' It really was.'
Joey:,"b' Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.\n(Chandler and Ross look at each other.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,\n""Hey, how you doin\x92?""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, please!'"
Joey:,"b' (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin\x92?'"
Joey:,b' Hey! How you doin\x92?'
Joey:,"b' I\x92d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She\x92s sleeping.\n(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the\nsame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses\nit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, Jill!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh my God, introduce us!'"
Rachel:,b' This is Chandler. (Points at him.)'
Rachel:,b' And you know Monica and Ross!'
Ross:,b' Hi Jill.'
Rachel:,"b' And that\x92s Phoebe (points), and that\x92s Joey.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin\x92?'"
Rachel:,b' Don\x92t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)'
Joey:,"b"" Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?\nBelieve me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."""
Joey:,"b' Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?'"
Joey:,b' What?!?! Oh dear God!'
Joey:,b' Not much to tell there I\x92m really shy.'
Joey:,b' Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)'
Joey:,b' Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the\ngang.) I did it!'
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Amazing! Amazing!'
Joey:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y\x92know?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! I can\x92t believe they didn\x92t put it in the part where you\nsaid you didn\x92t watch soap operas.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was\npretty nice about that.'"
Joey:,"b' Little bit, yeah.'"
Ross:,b' Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, that\x92s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.\n(Winks at him.)'"
Ross:,b' Did you just wink at me?'
Joey:,"b' Hey, you\x92re the one that loves the picture.'"
