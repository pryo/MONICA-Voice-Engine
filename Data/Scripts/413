Chandler:,"b' Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is '"
Ross:,b' People can hear you.'
Chandler:,b' I know!!'
Chandler:,b' Wow! She looks great. Doesn\x92t she?'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' That is one good looking man!'
Chandler:,"b' Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!'"
Ross:,b' Dude!'
Ross:,b' Here\x92s your girlfriend\x92s button. (Holding the button.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from\nhigh school?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, it\x92s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.'"
Rachel:,b' '
Rachel:,"b' No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a '"
Phoebe:,b' Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty\nrich people and tell them what to buy?'
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,b' That sounds great!'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)'
Joey:,b' (Holding a turkey leg) There\x92s gravy?'
Joey:,b' I think I left a donut up here.'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Ooh! How was Kathy\x92s play?'
Ross:,"b' Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good\nlookin\x92 guy.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s like someone '"
Phoebe:,b' '
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on\nstage every night, and then they\x92re gonna go to their cast parties and he\x92s\ngonna try to undermine me. Y\'know it\x92ll be like, ""So where\x92s your\nboyfriend, what\x92s-his-name, Chester?"" And she\x92ll go, ""No-no-no,\nit\x92s Chandler."" And he\x92ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!""'"
Joey:,b' (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.'
Chandler:,"b' All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?'"
Joey:,"b' Chandler, look they\x92re actors. They\x92re there to do a job, just\n\x91cause they work together, doesn\x92t mean they\x92re gonna get together. I mean\njust \x91cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn\x92t mean\nit\x92s gonna happen with them.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.'"
Joey:,b' Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. '
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.'"
Ross:,b' They\x92re not a couple!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh-okay, I get the game now.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on\nstage, was it like really hot?'"
Ross:,b' Oh yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Well okay, so then you\x92re fine. The rule is when two actors are\nactually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long\nas it\x92s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It\x92s when the heat goes\naway, that\x92s when you\x92re in trouble.'"
Chandler:,b' Really?'
Joey:,"b' Look, you guys have been to every play I\x92ve ever been in, have I ever\nhad chemistry on stage?'"
Ross:,b' No.'
Joey:,b' Noooo!!'
Chandler:,"b' So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what, I don\x92t know how comfortable I am going to see how\nhot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I know but\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no-no-no, I\x92m there.'"
Joey:,b' Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?'
Joey:,b' Yep! Grab a plate.'
Joey:,"b' No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which\nflies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin\x92 closer.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, okay, but don\x92t worry, because we also have cereals,\nmuffins, waffles, '"
Joey:,"b' Listen also we\x92re uh, we\x92re watching the game here Saturday\nnight, if people want to come over.'"
Ross:,b' Oh yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, who\x92s playing?'"
Ross:,b' Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.'
Joey:,"b' All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her\nplate.)'
Rachel:,"b' (on the phone) Monica, I\x92m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old\nwoman put on a thong and she didn\x92t even buy it! (Pause) I\x92m telling you\nI\x92m quitting! That\x92s it! I\x92m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I\nam! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you\nget this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah\nreally need to talk to you.'"
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Hi, I\x92m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I\x92m so sorry.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, at least that\x92s a great suit.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' No-no, that wasn\x92t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let\nme show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh-oh, sorry, it\x92s this way, it\x92s this way. (Motions to the\ncorrect way.)'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.\nBefore they had heat, and now there\x92s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey\ntold us what this means!'"
Ross:,"b' All right, let\x92s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was\nsome sexual chemistry between them.'"
Chandler:,"b' Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!'"
Ross:,"b"" Here she comes. Don\x92t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don\x92t\nbe\x85y'know you."""
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and '"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x85 (Walks away.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y\x92know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you\x92re\nup there every night, you\x92re naked, touching, kissing."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, you can understand, given how we started.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, that is what happened, and I don\x92t even see you denying\nthis!'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, well, don\x92t expect '"
Rachel:,"b' I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over\ntoday, and I got to dress him up all day!'"
Phoebe:,b' Rachel has a new doll.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them\ntogether and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised\nit, Joshua! Josh-'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, hello!'"
Rachel:,b' Hi-e!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, what do I smell?'"
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know, it smells good.'"
Phoebe:,b' Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)'
Ross:,"b' Oh, yumm!'"
Joey:,b' (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new '
Ross:,"b' Cookies and porn, you\x92re the best mom ever!!'"
Phoebe:,b' What? What?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be\nthere.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?'"
Rachel:,b' It\x92s Joshua.'
Ross:,"b' Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his\napartment. Joey follows him)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I don\x92t need it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Why? Honey, what is the big deal?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone\nhas to hang out in the big apartment?"""
Phoebe:,"b' If you wanted to punish them, you should\x92ve just made them hang out\nhere! '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s true.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, are we gonna trash that place?'"
Chandler:,b' Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at\nthe new '
Ross:,b' So you were right?'
Chandler:,"b' I confronted her, and she didn\x92t deny it! (Pause) I don\x92t\nlive here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)'"
Ross:,b' Chandler!'
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, what did she say?'"
Phoebe:,b' Wait a minute.'
Joey:,b' Come here.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to '"
Rachel:,b' '
Chandler:,b' Yes! See you and I have always been like\x97(motions that they think\nthe same.)'
Rachel:,"b' Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey\x92s.) Oh, hey, do you\nneed help with that?'"
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and\nJoey\x92s.)'"
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.\nIt\x92s just so frustrating!'"
Phoebe:,b' Why don\x92t you ask him out?'
Joey:,"b' Oh, yeah, totally! That\x92s such a turn-on!'"
Rachel:,b' Really? It doesn\x92t seem desperate?'
Joey:,"b' Oh-ooh, that\x92s the turn-on.'"
Phoebe:,b' He just got a divorce right? '
Rachel:,b' Hmm-mmm.'
Phoebe:,"b"" So he\x92s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you\njust have to make the first move."""
Rachel:,"b' Yeah but, I\x92ve never asked a guy out before.'"
Phoebe:,b' (shocked) You\x92ve never asked a guy out?!!'
Rachel:,b' No. Have you?'
Phoebe:,b' Thousands of times!! That doesn\x92t make me sound too good does it?'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t even know how I would go about it.'
Joey:,"b' Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,\n""Hey, how you doin\x92?""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, please!'"
Joey:,"b' (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin\x92?'"
Rachel:,"b' You know what, I\x92m gonna do that, I\x92m gonna call him up, and\nI\x92m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin\x92?\n(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It\x92s Rachel Green from '"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92ve never done that.'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, you gotta give him something that he can\x92t say no too. Like uh,\nKnicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you\x92re guaranteed he\x92ll say\nyes!'"
Rachel:,b' Really?! You think that will work?'
Joey:,"b' Absolutely! And if it doesn\x92t, can I get the extra ticket?'"
Joey:,b' What the heck is that?'
Chandler:,b' Did she call?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, sorry.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, maybe I should call her.'"
Joey:,"b' No! Forget her, man! You don\x92t need her, you don\x92t need that!'"
Ross:,"b' He\x92s right, what she did was unforgivable.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"""
Ross:,b' How might you be wrong?'
Chandler:,"b"" Well y'know, what if she didn\x92t actually sleep with the guy?"""
Joey:,"b' Dude, tell me she actually told you this.'"
Chandler:,"b' She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.\nBack me up here, Ross!'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s all you\x92re basing this on?'
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and\nthe heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There\x92s a lot of theories\nthat didn\x92t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh my God!!'
Rachel:,"b' Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You\nknow, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too\x85 (Tries again.)\nUmm, who likes the Knicks\x97(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!'"
Rachel:,"b' Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how\nthey would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like\nit?'"
Rachel:,b' Great.'
Rachel:,b' Sure.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah-eah-ha!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh well, you don\x92t want to do that now?!'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Basketball!'
Rachel:,"b' I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you\x92re\ninterested, just as a thank you for this week.'"
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,"b' Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I\x92m sorry.\nY\x92know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely\nunderstand why you were so upset.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y\x92know I-I think this is a\ngood thing. Y'know? \x91Cause we\x92ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.\nY\x92know, I know for me\x97(Notices a pair of men\x92s pants on the chair.)\nNick\x92s pants?"""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a '"
Joey:,"b' Okay, for next time, what do you say?'"
Rachel:,"b' I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an\nextra ticket.'"
Ross:,"b' So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?'"
Rachel:,"b' He didn\x92t turn me down! He\x92s at the game isn\x92t he? I got\nthe date, I\x92m just not on it!'"
Joey:,b' What\x92s ready?'
Ross:,b' Oh my God!'
Rachel:,b' Wow! Monica!'
Phoebe:,b' Great!'
Ross:,b' This is beautiful!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh did you\x97what did you\x97did you work for two days straight?'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know, it looks the same.'"
Joey:,b' Oh yeah!'
Ross:,"b' Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?'"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' How\x92d it go?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, she wasn\x92t sleeping with him.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh good!'
Chandler:,b' She is now.'
Ross:,b' What are you saying?'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m saying that she\x85 is a devil woman! Y\x92know I mean\nyou think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with\nhis rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I '"
Phoebe:,b' How? How is your fault?'
Chandler:,"b' Because, I-I should\x92ve called! Y\x92know if I had just called\nher after our big, stupid fight, she never would\x92ve gone out with Nick, and they\nwould\x92ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!'"
Rachel:,"b' Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it\ndoes not justify her sleeping with someone.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, if-if she thought they were on a break\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Rachel:,b' Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and\nholds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in '
