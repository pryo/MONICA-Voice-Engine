Joey:,b' What are you doing?'
Ross:,"b' I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.\n(There\x92s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There\x92s\none lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)'"
Joey:,b' Why are you doing this?'
Ross:,"b' Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I\x92ve already been to the\nbank, post office, and the dry cleaners.'"
Joey:,"b' Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You\x92ve got to\nspread it out a little, you know. Haven\x92t you ever been unemployed?'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, I am not '"
Joey:,"b' Hey, don\x92t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little\nconfused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why\ndo you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here\x85sit down. (Ross sits\ndown.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh,\nyeah!! Huh?!'"

Chandler:,b' Ohh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, yeah, I\x92m going to be out there spreading joy to the\npeople. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year,\nI\x92m going to do the whole city.'"
Joey:,"b' So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by '"

Joey:,b' She\x92s a woman!'
Joey:,"b' (Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put\nsome change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and\ndown as if she is spreading joy.)"""
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, it's going okay."""

Phoebe:,b' Thank you! And Happy Holidays.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Wait, you can't take the money out."""

Joey:,"b"" I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline\nthat takes, y'know? I can't do it."""
Ross:,"b"" I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to\nit. And plus, it'll give me something to do."""
Joey:,"b"" Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!"""
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,b' Thanks!'
Ross:,"b"" (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The\nonly thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."""
Joey:,b' Done!'

Rachel:,b' I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm\naround her.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our\nrelationship!!'"
Rachel:,"b' No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the\nplan!'"
Rachel:,"b"" She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the\ndate. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan."""
Joey:,"b' Hey, how do you spell suspicious? '"
Chandler:,b' Why?'

Joey:,"b' (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a\nnotch?'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm intrigued. """
Joey:,"b' All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. '"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit\nback.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.'"
Chandler:,b' Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?'
Joey:,"b' Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the\ndoor.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Thank you, Happy Holidays.'"
