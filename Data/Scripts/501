Ross:,"b' I, Ross\x85'"

Ross:,b' Yay!'
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Well, that went well. Yeah.'"
Chandler:,"b' It could\x92ve been worse, he could\x92ve shot her.'"
Ross:,"b' (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn\x92t it?'"
Joey:,"b' (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still\nget cake right?'"
Ross:,"b' (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that\x92s all right, no honey, you take\nyour time sweetie. I\x92ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the\ngang) She\x92s just fixing her makeup.'"
Ross:,"b' And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey,\nthis is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else\njoins him.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller\x92s\npersonal physician, Dr. Philange.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine,\nuh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women\x92s names are interchangeable,\nthrough-through no fault of his own.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hello?'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh wow, I hope you don\x92t take this the wrong way but, I know we\nhad plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I\x92m just kinda worried about what it might do\nto our friendship.'"
Chandler:,b' Seven times!'
Chandler:,b' In a '
Chandler:,b' Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I don\x92t see that we have a choice. But, when we\x92re\nback home, we don\x92t do it.'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Okay! '
Rachel:,"b' Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can\x92t pretend\nthat didn\x92t happen can I?'"
Rachel:,"b' Monica, what should I do?'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Whoa, wait, listen, I think I\x92m just gonna talk to Ross about what\nhe think it meant.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you\x92re right. You\x92re right. You can\x92t help me.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, what\x92s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak,\nhe\x92s eating it with his hands.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Forget it, that\x92s off.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I figured we\x92re in another country, so it doesn\x92t count.'"
Chandler:,b' The man\x92s got a point.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, hi!'"
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Hi. Sorry, things aren\x92t working out so well.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no! It could be better, but it\x92s gonna be okay, right?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she\x92s gonna get over this, y\x92know?\nI mean, so you said my name! Y\x92know you just said it \x91cause you saw me there, if\nyou\x92d have seen a circus freak, you would\x92ve said, ""I take thee circus\nfreak."" Y\x92know, it didn\x92t mean anything, it\x92s just a mistake. It\ndidn\x92t mean anything. Right?'"
Ross:,"b' No! No! Of course it didn\x92t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can\nunderstand why Emily would think it meant something, y\x92know, because-because it was\nyou\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Right\x85'
Ross:,b' But it absolutely didn\x92t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It\ndidn\x92t!! It didn\x92t!!'
Joey:,"b' (approaching) Ross, hey, the band\x92s ready outside for your first\ndance with Emily, so\x85'"
Ross:,"b' (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band\x92s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what\nthe band says\x97I don\x92t care about the stupid band!!'"
Joey:,b' You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)'
Ross:,"b' Look, I\x92m sorry.'"
Joey:,"b' Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?'"
Rachel:,"b' (laughs) Y\x92know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding,\nit was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, right!'"
Rachel:,"b' Get the hell out of there, y\x92know?'"
Ross:,"b' (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I\x92m coming in. (He opens\nthe door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, look at that, same thing.'"
Chandler:,"b' Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word,\n""Yippee!"" just ignore me.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, hello Rachel.'"
Rachel:,b' Ross said my name. Okay? '
Chandler:,"b' Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, we\x92ll be down in like five minutes.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It\x92s Phoebe!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yay\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hi, so what happened?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, Ross said my name.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I know, but I don\x92t think that means anything.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, Pheebs, y\x92know what, let\x92s look at this objectively all\nright? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade\nhe sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don\x92t we go change in my room?'"
Chandler:,"b' Wow, you look\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I\x92ve got a girl in here.'"
Joey:,"b' No you don\x92t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, we\x92re-we\x92re hanging out in here!'"
Joey:,"b' Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I suppose I\x92d have to say you!! But, what if we\x92re\nwatching a movie in here?'"
Joey:,b' '
Chandler:,"b' Well, Ross and Emily aren\x92t gonna use it.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The '"
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Ross:,b' (entering) Emily?!'
Chandler:,"b' Nope, not under here!'"
Ross:,"b' No, I\x92ve looked everywhere!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, you couldn\x92t have looked everywhere or else you\nwould\x92ve found her!'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, for about 30 minutes.'"
Chandler:,"b' Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)'"
Ross:,"b' No! For all I know, she\x92s trying to find me but couldn\x92t because\nI kept moving around. No, from now on, I\x92m staying in one place. (He sits down on the\nbed.) Right here.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, we\x92re gonna go.'"
Ross:,"b' Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s a very large plane.'"
Ross:,b' (disappointed) That\x92s cool.'
Chandler:,"b' But, we\x92ll stay here with you.'"
Ross:,"b' Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really\nappreciate this, y\x92know, but you don\x92t have to rub my butt.'"
Chandler:,b' We have to leave for New York in an hour.'
Chandler:,"b' We can\x92t do that that\x92s insane. I mean \x91A\x92 he\ncould wake up and \x91B\x92 y\x92know, let\x92s go for it.'"
Ross:,b' Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.)\nEmily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)'
Ross:,"b' Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?'"
Rachel:,"b' (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys\noh hurry up, get some, there\x92s a whole cart outside\x85 (Sees the Walthams and\nstops.)'"
Ross:,"b' Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are\nsupposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I\x92m gonna\nbe at that airport and I hope that she\x92ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel\x92s\nname, but it didn\x92t mean anything, Okay? She\x92s-she\x92s just a friend and\nthat\x92s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That\x92s all! Now just tell Emily that\nI love her and that I can\x92t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please,\npromise me that you\x92ll tell her that.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something)\nY\x92know, technically we still '"
Chandler:,b' \x91Kay!'
Joey:,b' Can I ask you something?'
Chandler:,"b' Uhh, no.'"
Joey:,"b' Felicity and I, we\x92re watching '"
Chandler:,b' No.'
Joey:,"b' I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y\x92know, you\nthink I\x92ll ever get there?'"
Chandler:,b' Yes.'
Joey:,b' Thanks man. '
Chandler:,b' Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)'
Joey:,b' But what about how much taller he is than me?'
Joey:,"b' I mean, there\x92s no way I can make myself taller now, y\x92know? And\nwho knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an\nunsuccessful, regular sized man?'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, Monica, wow you\x92ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.'"
Joey:,"b' Had the beef-tips, huh?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You\nhad sex! (They\x92re shocked.)'
Chandler:,b' No we didn\x92t!'
Phoebe:,"b' I know you didn\x92t, I was talking about Monica.'"
Phoebe:,b' This pregnancy is throwing me all off.'
Joey:,"b' All right, I\x92m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, me too!'"
Joey:,"b' Why would you need to say hi to them, you\x92ve been feeding them for\nfour days?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh right, maybe I\x92ll just go home. '"
Chandler:,"b' Yes! Good thing we have that, \x91Not in New York\x92 rule.'"
Chandler:,b' Right.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh. Y\x92know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn\x92t\nbecause I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me \x91cause,\nyou\x92re really hot! Is that okay?'"
Chandler:,b' And I\x92m cute too.'
Chandler:,"b' Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.'"
Chandler:,b' Bye. '
Chandler:,"b' (entering) I\x92m still on London time, does that count?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, good! (They start kissing.)'"
Ross:,b' Rach! Rach!'
Rachel:,b' (she stops and turns) Hi!'
Ross:,"b' Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I-I-I\x92ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours. '"
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?'"
Ross:,b' Not yet.'
Rachel:,"b' So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?'"
Ross:,b' Pretty soon I guess.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah. I\x92m sorry.'
Ross:,"b' I just, I don\x92t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?\nY\x92know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she\x92d actually\nshow up?'"
Rachel:,"b' No, you\x92re not an idiot, Ross. You\x92re a guy very much in love.'"
Ross:,b' Same difference.'
Ross:,"b' I get it! Well, that\x92s that.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, you know what, I think you should go.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear\nyour head, I think it\x92d be really good.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t, I don\x92t, I don\x92t know\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be '"
Ross:,"b' I could, yeah, I can do that.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'

Rachel:,b' Good!'
Ross:,"b' I know, why not?'"
Rachel:,b' Right!'
Ross:,b' Right?'
Rachel:,b' Right!'

Ross:,"b' Yeah, well\x85nah.'"

Ross:,"b' Why don\x92t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well-well, I don\x92t know Ross\x97really?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, yeah, it\x92ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I\ncan cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?'"
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Ross:,"b' No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!'"

Rachel:,"b' Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to\nRoss\x92s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey,\nlook at that, the airport\x92s moving. (Realizes that that\x92s not how it works.)\nHey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the\ncaptain know that we\x92re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.'"
