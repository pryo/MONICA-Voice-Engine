Joey:,b' Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)'
Chandler:,b' So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings\nthat we\x92re trying to get to play at the wedding?'
Phoebe:,b' Since when are you into swing music?'
Chandler:,b' Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!'
Chandler:,b' '
Chandler:,b' Do you want me to call?'
Phoebe:,b' What is your job?'
Chandler:,b' Staying out of the way.'
Joey:,"b' This is impossible Monica, why don\x92t you just pick all 15? (Hands\nback the paper.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, I added three.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah\x85 (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter,\nscooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)'"
Ross:,"b' (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello!\nShe\x92s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?'"
Chandler:,b' Sure! That\x92s one of the great things about being engaged.\nI\x92m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.'
Ross:,"b' Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.'"
Ross:,"b' (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.)\n(Calmly) So hi, I\x92m uh, I\x92m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly\nwaves.)'"
Ross:,"b' Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, \x91cause if you\nare\x85I\x92d love to show you around sometime.'"
Ross:,b' Ah.'
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this\nstreet is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen\ncrinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the\nstreet. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he\x92s talking\nabout.)'"
Chandler:,b' (To Ross) Smooth.'
Ross:,"b' Umm, say you\x92re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you\nsay I take you to dinner tonight?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Ross:,"b' Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he\x92s holding.)'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When\nshe\x92s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can\x92t pick it up.)'"
Phoebe:,b' (wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! You look so beautiful!'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!'"
Rachel:,b' I do the same thing.'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m just kidding too. (Laughs) I\x92m getting married in\nDecember. (Turns away not happy with herself.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, is that spelled with a \x91C\x92 or a \x91K\x92? Oh my God!\nIt doesn\x92t matter; they\x92re both great!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh y\x92know what? Y\x92know what? Now that you know what you want\nyou should go to Kleinman\x92s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.'
Rachel:,"b' So, does this (the dress) come in another color or\x85 (The store\nowner walks away.)'"
Joey:,"b' (checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin\x92 in or movin\x92 out?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, can I give you a hand?'"
Joey:,b' Boyfriend?'
Joey:,b' I\x92m Joey. (They shake hands.)'
Joey:,"b' Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?'"
Joey:,b' Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So\x85'
Joey:,b' Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a\nlittle tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your\nshoes gone.'
Joey:,"b' Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me\ntonight?'"
Joey:,b' Oh.'
Joey:,"b' Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? (The lamp he\x92s\nholding.)'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but\ndecides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I\x92ll grab this one. (He\nfollows her upstairs.)'"
Rachel:,b' (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Got it.'
Rachel:,b' Oh they\x92re pushing! They\x92re pushing!!'
Rachel:,b' Well I\x85'
Phoebe:,b' (coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!'
Phoebe:,b' (hearing the signal) I\x92m coming! I\x92m coming! (She takes off\ntowards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)'
Phoebe:,b' Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the\nother way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and\nfinds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the\nway to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What\nare you doing? (Rachel doesn\x92t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won\x92t stop\nso Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)'
Phoebe:,b' Did you find the dress?'
Rachel:,b' No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are\ncrazy!'
Phoebe:,b' I\x97We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)'
Rachel:,b' No! You gotta hold my hand!!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel\x92s hand and drags her towards Monica.)\nExcuse me! Excuse me! (She\x92s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.) '
Rachel:,b' (seeing who\x92s trapped) Hey\x85'
Chandler:,"b' So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the\nmagical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?'"
Ross:,"b' Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying\nshe\x92d like to go out again.'"
Chandler:,b' Huh.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah in fact, I\x92m gonna go call her right now. And I\x92ll make\nsure to tell her my friend Chandler says\x85 (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey Chandler!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Listen, sorry I didn\x92t stop by last night but I had a date.'"
Chandler:,"b' Uh Joe, when it\x92s one o\x92clock in the morning and you\ndon\x92t come by? That\x92s okay!'"
Joey:,"b' Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right\nacross the street!'"
Chandler:,b' Really? Right across the street?'
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' When\x92d you meet her?'
Joey:,b' Two days ago.'
Chandler:,b' Excellent! Y\x92know Ross met somebody too!'
Joey:,b' Oh yeah?'
Ross:,b' (returning) Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Hi! How\x92d it go?'
Ross:,b' Oh great! We\x92re going out again Saturday. But I just found she\x92s\nalso seeing some other guy.'
Chandler:,b' (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in\nRoss\x92s situation?'
Joey:,"b' Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I\x92m dating this girl who\x92s also\nseeing another guy. But, I don\x92t know, I\x92m not too worried about it.'"
Ross:,b' Well you shouldn\x92t be. Believe me I wouldn\x92t want to be the guy\nwho\x92s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!'
Chandler:,"b' So this is nice! I wish I didn\x92t have to go, believe me! But\nunfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way,\nwhat\x92s the name of the girl you\x92re dating?'"
Chandler:,b' Bye! (Exits.)'
Ross:,b' Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.'
Joey:,"b' Obviously! So, how do we decide?'"
Ross:,"b' Well now let\x92s-let\x92s look at this objectively, I think I should\ndate her\x85'"
Joey:,b' (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. '
Ross:,"b' That\x92s interesting, but check this out. I date her\x85'"
Joey:,b' Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction\x85'
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah well we should order some food then.'
Ross:,"b' No Joey! Look why don\x92t, why don\x92t we just let her decide? Okay?\nHey-hey, we\x92ll '"
Joey:,b' (smiling) That sounds fair.'
Ross:,b' Maybe I\x92ll take her to that new French restaurant down the\nstreet\x85'
Joey:,b' Ah yeah\x97wait a second now! Look we\x92re gonna have to set a\nspending limit on the date. I don\x92t have the money to take her to a fancy place like\nthat.'
Ross:,"b' Well sorry, that\x92s what I do on dates.'"
Joey:,"b' All right, well I guess I\x92ll just have to do what I do on dates.'"
Ross:,b' So let\x92s decide on the spending limit\x85'
Joey:,"b' Yeah. Uh, (thinks)\x85a slice\x85(Thinks)\x85six dollars?'"
Ross:,b' I was thinking more like a hundred.'
Joey:,b' Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?'
Phoebe:,b' I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)'
Rachel:,b' You\x92re out of '
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,b' (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?'
Phoebe:,b' Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.'
Rachel:,b' You\x92re out of toilet paper!'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey! What\x92s up?'
Joey:,"b' I just wanted to come by and y\x92know, wish you good luck on your date.'"
Ross:,b' Oh thanks!'
Joey:,b' Yeah. What time are you meeting her?'
Ross:,b' We have 8:00 reservations at Gramercy Bistro.'
Joey:,"b' Wow, that\x92s in like 20 minutes. You\x92d better get dressed.'"
Ross:,b' I am dressed.'
Joey:,b' Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is\nthis? Did you give yourself a facial?'
Ross:,b' I have an oily T-zone!'
Joey:,"b' Okay dude! (Finds a receipt.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s right.'
Joey:,b' You spent a hundred dollars. That\x92s the limit. You\x92re screwed!'
Ross:,"b' Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So\ntechnically, '"
Joey:,b' Oh-oh! So that\x92s the way it\x92s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the\nrules too y\x92know!'
Ross:,b' Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know.'
Ross:,b' Why am I not surprised?'
Joey:,b' Y\x92know what Ross? I\x92m not gonna let you get away with this!'
Ross:,b' I don\x92t think you have much choice.'
Joey:,b' Well we\x92ll see!'
Ross:,b' Bye-bye!'
Joey:,b' Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So\njust a light layer?'
Ross:,b' Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and\nthere (Runs his fingers across his forehead).'
Chandler:,b' Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom\nto wash his hands.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, swing music is so out.'"
Chandler:,b' (returning) What are you guys talking about?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two\nmonths later the couple got divorced. And now I\x92m not saying that there\x92s any\nconnection here y\x92know, but they did tell me that\x92s why they got divorced.'"
Chandler:,b' But I love swing music!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y\x92know they suck so much that people\nactually die at their concerts\x97They just stop living.'
Chandler:,"b' Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And\nthere\x92s another reason too.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, what is the other reason?'"
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t want to say.'
Rachel:,b' Well you have to because maybe it\x92s stupid.'
Chandler:,b' Well it\x92s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it\nwas\x85the first time I knew that\x85you were the woman I wanted to dance all my\ndances with.'
Ross:,b' So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Oh yeah it\x92s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they\ncan spasm out of control.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Kristen?'
Joey:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,"b' Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I\x92m not breaking\nany rules so I\x85'"
Joey:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,b' Hi. (They shake hands.) It\x92s nice to meet you. I used to have a\nfriend named Joey. I don\x92t anymore.'
Ross:,b' Yeah. So\x85'
Joey:,b' Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)'
Ross:,"b' So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s right! That\x92s right, don\x92t you play a woman?'"
Joey:,b' A woman in a man\x92s body.'
Ross:,b' Much better.'
Joey:,"b' So y\x92know Ross it\x92s funny \x91cause, you look familiar to me\ntoo. Have you ever been married?'"
Ross:,"b' Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were\ntalking about how I\x92ve been married '"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s right! Wait no, Ben.'"
Joey:,b' So you\x92ve just married the one time then?'
Ross:,b' Well umm\x85'
Ross:,"b' Yes. And another time after that. Boy I\x92m getting hungry! Hey Joey,\nhave you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you\nate some\nof her food?'"
Joey:,"b' (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now\x97why did that first\nmarriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?'"
Joey:,b' No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman\non the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.'
Ross:,b' Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?'
Joey:,b' Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!'
Ross:,b' Hey you leave Marcel out of this!'
Joey:,b' Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!'
Ross:,b' Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!'
Joey:,b' Monkey lover!'
Joey:,b' When do you think we lost her?'
Ross:,b' Probably around gonorrhea.'
Chandler:,"b' Hi, honey! I\x92m home!'"
Chandler:,b' Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something?'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know it\x92s funny I started it but, now it\x92s\nscaring me.\nSo could you come out here please?'"
Chandler:,b' Oh you got a wedding dress? That\x92s great!'
Chandler:,b' Well then why can\x92t I see it?'
Chandler:,b' Okay I promise. I\x92ll-I\x92ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow!\nYou-you look\x85hideous.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s like the most ugliest dress I\x92ve ever seen.\nWh-why do you have to return it?'"
Chandler:,b' Oh that\x92s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it\x92s\nlike yuck! It\x92s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!'
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Chandler:,b' (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we\x92re gonna have younger\nlooking skin!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Y\x92know, she could use a\nlittle\x85(Whistles that she needs to do what they\x92re doing.) (Something happens on\nthe game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)'"
