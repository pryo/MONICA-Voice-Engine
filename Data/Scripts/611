Rachel:,b' Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows\nher the picture.)'
Rachel:,b' Yeah! It\x92s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an\napothecary is?'

Rachel:,b' Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way\nfrom the White Plains store.'
Joey:,b' Hey! I made that for her!'
Chandler:,b' You made pottery?'
Joey:,b' Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay fine! I\x92ll-I\x92ll just tell her it\x92s an antique\napothecary table, she doesn\x92t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this\nlittle drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' \x85so then the farmer says, ""That\x92s not a cow and\nyou\x92re not milking it."" (Everyone laughs.) '"
Chandler:,"b' Look at us, we\x92re a couple of couples!'"
Joey:,b' And Chandler I can\x92t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug\nand he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.'"

Joey:,b' What-what\x92s wrong with Monica and Chandler?'
Joey:,b' Blah?!'
Joey:,"b' Uh, they\x92re like my best friends. Are you saying we can\x92t hang\nout with them? \x91Cause that would kinda be a problem.'"
Joey:,b' I guess.'
Joey:,"b' If you want, I\x92ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you\npresents.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?'"

Phoebe:,b' Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She\x92s opening and\nclosing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, yes.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.'"
Rachel:,b' Almost.'
Phoebe:,b' How much was it?'
Rachel:,b' It was only 500 bucks.'
Phoebe:,b' 500 bucks at a flea market?!'

Rachel:,b' I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table\nshe\x92s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.'
Ross:,b' Why did you do that?'
Rachel:,b' Because she hates'
Ross:,b' She hates '
Rachel:,"b' I know! I know, she says it\x92s all mass-produced, nothing is\nauthentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come\non, she\x92s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!\nPlease?'"
Ross:,"b' What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe\x97Ooh, although I did\nget some great '"

Rachel:,"b' Ross, she\x92s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a\nkind.'"
Ross:,b' Huh. Y\x92know what\x92s not one of a kind? A twin!'

Ross:,"b' Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? '"
Phoebe:,b' Sure!'
Rachel:,b' He got it a flea market!'
Phoebe:,"b' You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen\nthe purse strings a little.'"
Joey:,b' Hi!'
Chandler:,"b' And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands\nit to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn\x92t afford it,\nbecause you paid dinner last night.'"

Joey:,"b' Uh, y\x92know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.'"
Joey:,"b' Well uh, she didn\x92t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a\nrow. I\x92m so sorry.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!'"
Joey:,"b' Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are\ntoo loud.'"
Chandler:,b' So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was\nlying to our faces?!'
Chandler:,"b' And I am not blah, I am a hoot!'"
Joey:,"b' I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don\x92t-don\x92t be\nmad. I\x92m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys\nare like my best friends! Y\x92know? And it was our first date! Plus, she\x92s really\nsick!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, you sh\x97No you said you made that up!!'"
Joey:,"b' I know, but don\x92t you think the sick thing is way better than the\nplay thing?'"
Chandler:,"b' Eh, they\x92re both good. I generally just go with, Monica\x92s\ndrunk again. (Monica glares at him.) '"
Joey:,"b' Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?\nShe\x92ll come around I promise.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,b' (shouting) I can hear you!'
Rachel:,b' That\x92s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross\x92s table.)'
Ross:,"b' Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new\x85(On\nRachel\x92s glare)\x85old sheet?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her\nwhich spills the wine.) Noo!'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh!!'
Ross:,b' My apothecary table!!!'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,b' Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same\napothecary table they have.) '
Phoebe:,"b' Ross, where did you get this?!'"
Ross:,b' I got it at '
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, Phoebe, '"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow! Oh my God, well if they\x92ve ripped off our table ours must be\nmuch more than one and fifty dollars!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh yes.'
Phoebe:,b' Well this doesn\x92t even smell like opium.'
Ross:,"b' Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for\nwrecking my sheet by the way.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh Ross, calm down, I\x92ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at\nRachel)'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, one more time.'"
Chandler:,b' Perfect decibel.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,"b' So uh, what are you guys doing?'"

Joey:,"b' That\x92s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your\nrelationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like\nan idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!'"
Joey:,b' You don\x92t think I know that!'
Rachel:,"b' \x85see I can\x92t decide whether it would go better next to the new\nwicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.'"
Ross:,b' Wow! I didn\x92t know that there was a '
Rachel:,"b' I know, I know. I went a little crazy.'"
Ross:,b' A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!\nThe ornamental bird cage! Large!'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early\nColonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.'"
Ross:,b' (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.'
Phoebe:,b' (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial\ntimes.'"
Phoebe:,b' Ah!'
Ross:,"b' Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other\ntime periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Well there\x92s yore. And uh, y\x92know, yesteryear.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah no, I\x92m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this\nstuff. Ross, y\x92know if you ever decide you need to redecorate\x97And I think that\nyou should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh honey he doesn\x92t need my help.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, come on! I think he\x92s ready to get rid of, what did you call\nit? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.'"
Ross:,"b' Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y\x92know what? Since you have such a great\nsense of what I need, uh ooh, here\x92s-here\x92s 60 bucks, why don\x92t you take\nPhoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.'"
Rachel:,"b' (not sure of what to do) Y\x92know what? I don\x92t, I don\x92t\nthink Phoebe really wants to come.'"
Phoebe:,b' No! I do want to!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, she does want to.'"
Ross:,b' She does want to.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,"b' Pheebs, I don\x92t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just\nbetter last time.'"
Phoebe:,b' Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Uck, look at this! '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, y\x92know what? Don\x92t look at it. (Realizes the display is\ntheir living room) Seriously, don\x92t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)'"
Phoebe:,b' No! Look-look! There\x92s the coffee table they stole from us!'
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, those bastards! Let\x92s go.'"
Phoebe:,b' That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the\x85wait a\nsec! This is our exact living room!'
Rachel:,"b' No! No! No! No it\x92s not! No it\x92s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is\ntotally different! I mean we don\x92t have the\x85 (Looks desperately for something\ndifferent.) We don\x92t have the\x85that lamp! And-and that screen is y\x92know, on\nthe other side.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, '"
Rachel:,"b' Okay! Okay-okay look\x97no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know\nhow you feel about '"
Phoebe:,"b' No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that\nis wrong with the world! And it\x92s all sitting up in my living room and all I can\nthink about is how I don\x92t have that lamp!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.'"
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t! I can\x92t! Unless\x85 Well are you saying that-that\nyou would move out if-if I didn\x92t buy that lamp?'
Rachel:,b' What?! No! I\x92m not gonna move out!'
Phoebe:,b' But are you saying that you would move out if I didn\x92t buy that\nlamp?'
Rachel:,b' (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would '
Phoebe:,b' Okay then I don\x92t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!'
Rachel:,b' That\x92s right!'
Phoebe:,b' But at least the apothecary table is real.'
Joey:,"b' Well, this-this-this was great. Didn\x92t everybody have a great time?'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s totally understandable.'
Chandler:,b' Oh yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Oh well then, good night!'"
Joey:,"b' See? Eh, wasn\x92t that fun?'"
Chandler:,"b' And I\x92m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching\nmodern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) ""Oh Chandler,\nI just lost myself in the moment.""'"
Joey:,b' All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and\nMonica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) Y\x92know I think you can take her.'
Joey:,"b' All right, uh, we\x92ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people\nare my friends; you can\x92t treat them that way.'"
Joey:,"b' I know! I know! And I\x92m going to talk to them about it. They mean so\nmuch to me. They\x85 They\x92re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all\nthe time, I-I\x85 I don\x92t think we can be together. It just, it just can\x92t\nwork. It can\x92t. (Starts to break up) I\x92m very upset.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her\nand she exits into the hallway.)'
Chandler:,b' Did you hear that?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! (They head downstairs.)'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' How ya doin\x92?'
Chandler:,"b' Hey so, did uh, did she move out?'"
Joey:,"b' Pretty much, yeah.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, when it\x92s not right, you know it.'"
Chandler:,b' You okay?'
Joey:,b' Yeah! Yeah. I\x92ll be all right.'
Ross:,b' Y\x92know what would cheer you up?'
Joey:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think\nyou should come.'"
Joey:,b' (laughing hysterically) You\x92re right! That did cheer me up!'
