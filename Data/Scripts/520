Joey:,b' Did I say you could smell it?!'
Chandler:,"b"" I can't smell your sandwich?"""
Joey:,"b"" Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!"""

Chandler:,b' How do you figure that?'
Ross:,"b"" Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."""
Ross:,"b' Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)'"
Ross:,"b"" Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there\nflashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"""

Ross:,"b"" And it could've just as easily have been a bullet."""
Chandler:,b' Who jumps at loud noises!'
Ross:,"b"" Wow! I could've died tonight."""

Chandler:,b' What picture?'
Joey:,"b"" I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!"""

Chandler:,"b' So you risked your life, for a sandwich!'"
Joey:,"b' I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the\nsandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!'"
Chandler:,"b"" So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."""
Joey:,"b"" No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!"""

Rachel:,"b"" Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?"""
Ross:,b' The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had\nan actual near death experience!'

Rachel:,b' Because a car backfired?'
Ross:,"b' (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I-I-I don\'t know how this fits into your whole ""seizing""\nthing but um, Emily called you today.'"
Ross:,b' You talked to her?'
Rachel:,"b"" No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But\nit-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine."""
Ross:,"b' Well, okay, what-what did she say?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and\ndid you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.'"
Ross:,b' Wow!'
Rachel:,"b' Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?'"
Ross:,"b' Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!'"

Ross:,"b"" You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to\nseize! Y'know?"""

Ross:,b' Huh.'
Rachel:,"b"" I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,\ny'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to """
Ross:,"b"" That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I\nreally don't wanna see or talk to her."""

Ross:,"b' Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.'"
Rachel:,b' (laughing) Close call day.'

Phoebe:,"b"" Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a\ngood story."""
Ross:,"b"" I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but\nheavy fire, like I was in a war or something."""
Chandler:,b' Before or after you were shot by your own troops?'
