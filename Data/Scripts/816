Ross:,b' Rachel who\x92s carrying my baby? Rachel?'
Joey:,"b' Look no, I-I know it\x92s bad, and I know it\x92s wrong. Okay? But-but\nit\x92s not like anything\x92s ever gonna happen. Y\x92know? These-these are just\nfeelings, they\x92re gonna go away.'"

Rachel:,b' Whoa!!'
Chandler:,b' Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)'
Rachel:,b' Wow that was a big one.'
Chandler:,b' I think that\x92s the youngest girl ever to reject me.'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Oh hey you guys!'
Chandler:,b' Oh hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there\nfor everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That\x92s why\nI stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He\x92ll find me.'
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?'"
Chandler:,"b' No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each\nother and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don\x92t think they exist.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, good.'"
Chandler:,b' Why?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well last night, I met Monica\x92s.'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other\nhalf.'"
Chandler:,"b' Come on, don\x92t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don\x92t think\nthere\x92s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at\nhim.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (To Phoebe) Well, what\x92s he like?!'"
Phoebe:,b' Well he\x92s tall.'
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,b' He has brown hair.'
Rachel:,"b' Of course, of course.'"
Chandler:,"b' A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!'"
Phoebe:,b' He works with food!'
Rachel:,b' Oh sure. Older?'
Phoebe:,"b' Obviously, and he\x92s British.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I was just gonna ask!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah? And, he\x92s-he\x92s so centered and mature and confident.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it\x92s so sad they never had a chance to meet.'"
Chandler:,"b' Luckily, the guy she settled for can\x92t hear what you\x92re\ntalking about.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I\x92m so sorry. Um, and maybe I\x92m wrong! I\nbut\x97y\x92know I\x92m gonna go out with him again, I\x92ll find out more.'"
Chandler:,b' You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you\x92re\nstill gonna date him?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl\x92s gotta eat.'"
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' Oh y\x92know, I still\x97I can\x92t believe it. Joey and Rachel I\nmean it\x92s\x85 It\x92s like you and me going out, only weirder!'"
Ross:,"b' Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he\x92d be the\nstepfather of my child.'"
Ross:,"b' Sure, because women never like Joey. Y\x92know, I think he\x92s a\nvirgin.'"
Ross:,b' He\x92s not?'
Ross:,b' Why?'
Ross:,"b' Hate him? I\x85 No, I don\x92t hate him. (Pause) It\x92s just\nit\x92s Rachel, y\x92know?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay. Okay, I\x92ll talk to him.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.'"
Phoebe:,b' (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.'
Chandler:,b' (mouths to Phoebe) What?'
Phoebe:,b' (cough talks) Soul mate.'
Chandler:,b' What\x92s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)\nOn a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there\x92s staring.) No?'
Chandler:,b' What are you doing?!'
Phoebe:,b' Nothing! I swear to God I didn\x92t know you guys would be here! And\nthe good news is you didn\x92t believe in soul mates. So\x85'
Chandler:,"b' I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!'"
Phoebe:,"b' They\x92re just talking, and y\x92know what? Just because I think\nthey\x92re soul mates doesn\x92t mean anything\x92s gonna happen.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b' Don\x92t worry, we\x92ll find you someone else.'"
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.'"
Ross:,"b' No, I don\x92t want to hit you.'"
Joey:,b' Oh what then? Kick me?'
Ross:,b' No.'
Joey:,b' (getting worried) Bite me?'
Ross:,"b' No, no I don\x92t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to\ntell you that I\x92m not mad at you and\x85and that I certainly do not hate you. I\njust, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)'"
Joey:,b' Oh now\x97Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or\nsomething?'
Ross:,b' Uh\x85yeah sure. (Enters.)'
Joey:,"b' Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel\nleft. I don\x92t\x85'"
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something\nokay? I uh\x85I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do\nanything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)'"
Ross:,b' Thank you.'
Joey:,"b' Anyway, it uh\x85look it\x92ll just\x85take me a while to get over\nher, that\x92s all. I\x92m not even sure how to do that, I mean I\x92ve never been\nin love before so\x85'"
Ross:,b' What?! You\x92re in love with her.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I thought you knew that.'"
Ross:,"b' Umm, no.'"
Joey:,"b' Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don\x92t want to feel this way. Honest. I\njust keep thinking, ""Ah, I\x92ll get over this."" Y\x92know? I just\x97It\njust keeps gettin\x92 harder. I don\x92t, I don\x92t know what to do. Y\x92know?\nWhat do I do?'"
Ross:,b' I think you need to tell her how you feel.'
Joey:,b' Okay that\x92s the green stuff talkin\x92.'
Ross:,"b' No, I\x92m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if\nshe\x92s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.'"
Joey:,b' But what if uh\x97and I\x92m not saying she will be\x97But\x85'
Ross:,b' If she is where you are then uh\x85then my feeling weird about it\nshouldn\x92t stand in the way.'
Joey:,b' Are you sure?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah. Look if-if she\x92s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is\nshe couldn\x92t find a better guy. So\x85'"
Joey:,b' Hey thanks.'
Ross:,b' So when do you think you\x92re gonna talk to her?'
Joey:,b' Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven\x92t even thought about what I\nwill say. What should I say?'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m understanding, but let\x92s not get carried away.'"
Joey:,"b' I\x92m sorry, you\x92re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another\nsip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys\nanother sip.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Cheese you say? That\x92s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?'"
Chandler:,"b' Cheese, it\x92s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.'"
Chandler:,b' Is it made of cheese?'

Chandler:,b' What do we do?'
Phoebe:,"b' I don\x92t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I\ndon\x92t know how you fight that.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand\nup straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as\nRachel opens the door and startles him.)'"

Joey:,"b' I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay what\x92s up?'

Chandler:,"b' Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sorry, did you say cheese?'"
Chandler:,"b' Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don\x92t believe in\nthat kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won\x92t stand in\nyour way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.'"
Chandler:,b' No. But I\x92m sure (mimics Don) \x91tomatoes\x92 does.'

Rachel:,b' \x85and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he\ntouches my stomach. I mean I\x92m really worried the baby\x92s not going to like him.\n(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?'
Joey:,"b' What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason\x85(Exhales\nslowly)\x97Is it hot in here?'"

Joey:,"b' I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin\ndoing Hobbs.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater\nout, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Huh. Wow, I wouldn\x92t think Hobbs would like that so much.'"
Joey:,b' Uh\x85 How long have we known each other?'
