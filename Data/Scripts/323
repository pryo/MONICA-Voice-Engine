Joey:,"b' Oh! Maybe they\'ll name yours after you! Y\'know, they\'ll call it, The Ross.\nAnd then people would be like, ""Awww, he\'s got a Ross.""'"
Ross:,"b"" (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!"""

Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it\x92s just Jason\x92s so\nsensitive, y'know?

Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"""
Rachel:,"b' OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at\nher.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it\x92d be like to catch the money bouquet. '"

Phoebe:,"b' Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?'"
Rachel:,b' You didn\x92t break up with that fireman?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he\x92s\nincredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal\ndrawings that he drew of me.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow!'

Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I\x92m gonna do that for you.'"
Chandler:,"b' (comforting the duck) Everything\x92s gonna be all right. Okay,\nDick?'"
