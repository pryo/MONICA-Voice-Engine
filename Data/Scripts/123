Chandler:,"b"" Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the\n50's."""
Ross:,"b"" God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first\ncontraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."""
Rachel:,"b"" What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"""
Chandler:,b' You have to pick your moments.'
Phoebe:,"b' Did I miss it, did I miss it?'"

Rachel:,"b"" And if you need anything else, I\x97(notices the handsome Dr.\nFranzblau)\x97do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's...\nex-husband's... sister's roommate. """
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, that's funny!"""

Phoebe:,b' Ok.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.'"
Chandler:,"b"" You'll get one."""
Chandler:,"b"" All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are\nmarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no, no.'"
Chandler:,"b' (trapped) Uh, uh.'"
Chandler:,b' Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back\nof the chair he was sitting in)'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr.\nFranzblau been by?"""
Rachel:,"b' Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby\nneeds him?'"
Chandler:,"b' Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your\nfather a doctor? '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, why?'"
Chandler:,"b"" No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)"""
Joey:,b' Tribbiani.'
Joey:,"b"" (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just\nfriends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?"""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if\nsomeone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"""
Joey:,"b' Ok, look, maybe I should just go.'"
Joey:,"b' Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? '"

Joey:,"b' Oh, it is.'"
Joey:,b' It is.'

Ross:,b' Breathe.'
Ross:,b' Breathe.'
Ross:,"b' 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...'"
Ross:,b' Who the hell is Jordie?'
Ross:,"b"" No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is\nJamie."""

Ross:,"b"" Oh, I'm threatened by you?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you\nguys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building\nand your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just\nstop all the yelling, just stop it!"""
Ross:,"b' Yeah, Susan.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."""

Ross:,"b"" Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all\nyour fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is\nbeing born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."""
Ross:,"b' No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,\nok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with\nthe baby, ok? Where does that leave me?'"
