Joey:,"b"" (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting\ndirector in town!

Ross:,b' Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.'
Joey:,"b"" Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an\naudition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather."""
Ross:,"b"" You're not his godfather."""

Rachel:,"b' (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror\nstories\x85(stops and tries to change directions)\x85about ghosts and goblins who\ntotally supported the princess's right to smoke."""

Chandler:,"b' Yeah, it is the best.'"
Rachel:,"b"" I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside\nsmoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid\nclean air, y'know?

Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I can do that.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.'"

Rachel:,"b"" Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out\nhere and get some fresh air."""
Rachel:,b' Oh great!'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh that's okay."""
Rachel:,"b"" Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know\nwhat, actually\x85 (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim\nare standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y\'know? Y\'know what I\nmean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are\ncrazy!"" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, me too.'"
Rachel:,"b' (Laughs) Oh, me too.'"

Ross:,"b"" What's up?"""
Joey:,"b"" Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me\ngoing up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I\nthink I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition."""
Ross:,"b"" Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man."""
Joey:,"b"" That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career\nwe're talking about here!"""
