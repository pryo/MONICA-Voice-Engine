Chandler:,b' Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped '
Chandler:,b' I\x92m not macho.'
Chandler:,"b' No, I guess I just never really cried. Y\x92know? I\x92m not a\ncrying kind of guy.'"
Joey:,"b' Come on man there\x92s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like\nuh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92d be sad sure, but I wouldn\x92t cry.'"

Joey:,"b' Oh, you\x92re Phoebe\x92s fan!'"
Joey:,b' Movies?'
Joey:,b' (laughs) I don\x92t think so.'
Joey:,"b' Hey Gunther, don\x92t let that guy in here anymore! He just said\nPhoebe\x92s a porn star!'"
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Ohhh well. Y\x92know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a\nguy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work\nnamed Bob! He\x92s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.'
Rachel:,"b' It\x92s not random, it\x92s Bob.'"
Rachel:,"b' No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because\nI asked him to.'"

Rachel:,b' I\x92m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what '
Rachel:,b' Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being\na brat! Wanting what you can\x92t have!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!'"
Rachel:,b' '
Rachel:,b' \x85I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess\nCaroline?!'
Rachel:,b' Do I have my own castle?'
Ross:,"b' Hey! Uh, Phoebe\x92s not here is she?'"
Rachel:,b' No.'
Joey:,"b' Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don\x92t think it\x92s the kind\nyou\x92re gonna like.'"
Chandler:,b' You didn\x92t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for\nthe tissues all night did you?'

Chandler:,b' Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!'
Joey:,b' Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.'
Ross:,"b' And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of\nhim to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn\x92t know he was in there. (They\nall kinda look at him.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow! I mean, I just\x97I can\x92t, I can\x92t believe this.\nY\x92know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who\x92s always been\nsomewhat of a question mark.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don\x92t do porn.'"
Joey:,"b' All right well, I\x92d better take that back.'"
Joey:,b' We can\x92t watch that! I mean that\x92s Phoebe!'

Ross:,b' Yeah! Good for you Joe!'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' Her ankle is what you\x92re watching?'
Rachel:,"b' Well it\x92s hard to tell\x85 (Rachel gets up to get a closer look,\nonly she\x92s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.'"
Chandler:,b' She\x92s just doing her job!'
Joey:,b' (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it\x92s a tattoo! That\x92s weird, Phoebe doesn\x92t\x85\nWait that\x92s Ursula! That\x92s not Phoebe that is Ursula!'"
Joey:,b' Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey! What\x92s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I\ndoing?!!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the\ncouch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)'"
Chandler:,b' There\x92s no back to this couch!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y\x92know? Maybe one of those\nstories would make me cry and then you wouldn\x92t think I was y\x92know, all dead\ninside.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.'
Chandler:,"b' No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,\nwe\x92re up at the altar and I\x92m like this. (Makes a bored face.)'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, well I won\x92t uh, worry about this anymore then.'"
Chandler:,"b' Aww, I love you so\x85'"
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,b' So you didn\x92t mean any of that?!'
Ross:,"b' You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to\x85 (Opens the\ndoor to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that\x92s just a little game\nI play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they\x92ve really taken a liking to me.\n(Quickly looks out to see if they\x92re watching.) Uhh\nwhat\x92s-what\x92s-what\x92s the matter?'"
Ross:,"b' Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, umm\x85'"
Ross:,b' What?'

Ross:,"b' Well, I\x92d love to! Here, you wait right here and I\x92ll go get the\nprojector and my notes!'"
Ross:,b' Ohh!'
Rachel:,b' Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can\x92t find her anywhere.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, is Ross home? Maybe I\x92ll just call him to see if he\x92s\nactually seen her. '"
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s Phoebe! Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,b' (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you\x92re making porn movies.'
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re making one right now!'

Ross:,b' Slides are almost ready.'
Ross:,"b' Uh okay, well there\x92s-there\x92s wine in the kitchen.'"
Ross:,b' (answering it) Hello?'
Rachel:,b' (on phone) '
Ross:,"b' O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she\x92s really upset we\x92re\njust talking.'"
Rachel:,b' Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get\nback at me!'
Ross:,b' So that\x92s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn\x92t\nhave anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I\x92m a good listener and I uh I put\non a '
Rachel:,"b' Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? I think I can take care of myself, I\x92ll talk to you\nlater. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)\nWhoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you\x92re just using me.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh no, not you too!'"
Phoebe:,b' No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay\x92s checks; there were a\nlot of them.'
Joey:,b' Nice!'
Phoebe:,"b' Um-mmm, '"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s great, but isn\x92t it gonna bother that people still think\nyou\x92re a porn star?'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.'
Joey:,b' You do?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying\nto remember where he\x92s seen her before.) (To him) You\x92re trying to figure out\nwhere you know me from? All right, I\x92ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries\nto rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To\nJoey) See?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh! I knew it! What happened?'
Ross:,"b' Umm, she kissed me.'"
Rachel:,b' What?! You kissed!'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.'
Ross:,"b' Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, it doesn\x92t sound like it! I mean, it\x92s pretty easy not\nto kiss someone, you just don\x92t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!'"
Ross:,"b' Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn\x92t stop it.\nI guess I-I just wasn\x92t thinking\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah that\x92s right you weren\x92t thinking! Y\x92know what? Let\nme give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)'
Ross:,b' Oh wait\x97hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the\nkissing.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister\x92s mouth\nlong enough to tell me that.'"
Ross:,b' Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing\ncould ever happen with us!'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' No, I mean, look I don\x92t know if anything is going to happen with us,\nagain. Ever. But I don\x92t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she\ngot mad and broke my projector.'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow. I, I don\x92t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks\nhim.)'"
Ross:,b' You\x92re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)'
Chandler:,b' (crying hysterically) I just don\x92t see why those two can\x92t\nwork things out!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I got that.'"
Ross:,b' You take care Jill.'
Rachel:,b' Bye-bye-e!'
Chandler:,"b' (starts crying) I-I can\x92t believe Jill\x92s gone. (They all\nlook at him.) I can\x92t help it, I opened a gate.'"
