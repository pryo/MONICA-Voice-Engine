Rachel:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I\nshould be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them."""
Ross:,b' Really.'
Rachel:,"b' No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.'"
Ross:,"b"" Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with\nmen!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right\nguy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With\nPaolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."""
Ross:,"b' Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's\nlike, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?"""
Ross:,"b"" Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone\nwho you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."""
Ross:,b' ...Gets interrupted. Hi!'

Chandler:,"b"" I can't believe we are even having this discussion."""
Joey:,"b"" I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."""
Chandler:,"b"" I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they\nwould've happened already?"""
Ross:,"b"" I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone\nexactly like me."""
Joey:,b' She really said that?'
Ross:,"b"" Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for\nsomeone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."""
Joey:,"b"" 'Tonight' tonight?"""

Chandler:,"b"" I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey."""
Ross:,"b"" Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over\nthere and, uh, try to woo her."""
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the\n1890's, when that phrase was last used."""
Rachel:,"b"" Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used\nto be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.\nOkay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with\nMonica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the\nshoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the\nnewsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.\nLittle engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that.

There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?\nWho died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,\nright Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the\nopen door)"""

Ross:,"b"" Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"""
Rachel:,"b' Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. You, uh, you want some?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it\nhere. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?"""
Ross:,"b"" Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder\ncapital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we\nwere, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)\nWell-"""

Ross:,b' ...Yeah?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.'"
Ross:,"b"" (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do\nwas keep him in the apartment."""
Rachel:,"b"" I know, I know, I'm sorry-"""
Ross:,"b"" No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,\nuh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a\npencil."""
Rachel:,"b"" (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody\nlooking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?"""
Rachel:,"b"" See? I've even called Animal Control!"""
Ross:,b' You called Animal Control?'

Joey:,"b"" We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry,\nbut... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers\nto the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us\nout."""

Rachel:,"b"" Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?\nYou want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the\nsign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you """
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel\nany more!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort\nof happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally\noblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."""

Rachel:,"b"" Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"""
Ross:,"b"" (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been\nfat."""
Rachel:,"b"" Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming\nqueen and the class president and you... were also there!

C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!\nTake it!"""
Rachel:,"b' Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that\nyou shot my friend in the ass with a dart?'"
Ross:,"b"" It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel\nresists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."""
