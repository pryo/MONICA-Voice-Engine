Ross:,b' All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under\nseven minutes! We did it!!'
Rachel:,"b' (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is '"
Ross:,"b' No, but come on, we\x92re off to a great start aren\x92t we? I knew\nI\x92d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh you made it!'
Rachel:,b' Hi! (Ross is stunned.)'
Ross:,b' Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?'
Ross:,"b' N\x85 No! We took a cab too, but I did '"
Chandler:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' Hey! You made it!'
Ross:,b' Okay is there\x85some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, you stay here and talk, I\x92m gonna go have a baby.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green.\nI\x92m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.'"
Rachel:,"b' (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I\x92m sorry, semi-private? We\n(Laughs), we asked for a private room.'"
Chandler:,"b' Man, if only you\x92d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at\nhim.)'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)'
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,b' Give her some money.'
Ross:,b' I really think they\x92re out of rooms.'
Rachel:,"b' They\x92re not!! Ross, they\x92re just saving them for the important\npeople!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!'"
Ross:,"b' Well then we\x92d be in a lot of trouble, you don\x92t know where any\ncountries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by\nRachel.) Uh, say would you umm\x85 Would you mind checking again to see if any umm,\nprivate rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?'"
Rachel:,b' (standing up) Okay. Y\x92know what? I\x92d have to say I really\ndon\x92t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have\nno problem to\x97Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!'
Ross:,b' What-what?'
Rachel:,b' Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing\nheavily.)'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, it couldn\x92t hurt to look.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, okay.'"
Ross:,b' Thank you.'
Rachel:,"b' Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He\x92s looking at the stirrups\non the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his\nlegs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah well it looks great!'
Ross:,"b' Hi! Hi, I\x92m uh Ross. I\x92m here to ruin this magical day for you.'"
Ross:,b' Hi Julie.'
Ross:,b' This is Rachel. (Points at her.)'
Rachel:,b' Hi! '
Rachel:,b' How are you?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah it is.'
Rachel:,b' That\x92s so sweet.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Oh.'
Ross:,"b' Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you\nguys some privacy.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, okay.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, I really don\x92t want any\x97(He takes the picture)\x97Oh!\nThank you. Oh. Oh Ross\x85'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Here comes another contraction.'
Ross:,"b' Oh. Okay, just breathe.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the\nmiracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.'"
Phoebe:,b' Sure! What?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay. I\x92ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we\x92re\nready.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, this is fun.'"
Joey:,b' You\x92re ready to have a baby? My boy\x92s all grown up!'
Chandler:,b' But you said you were ready too.'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, but haven\x92t you wanted a kid like forever?'"
Joey:,b' (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, that\x92s very\x97Really very-very okay.'"
Rachel:,"b' (simultaneously as Ross) No, I don\x92t think we\x92ll be doing\nthat.'"
Ross:,b' (simultaneously as Rachel) We\x92re not gonna do that.'
Ross:,b' Uh yes! Thank you.'
Rachel:,b' Oh. Oh wait no.'
Ross:,b' Later.'
Rachel:,b' No-no-don\x92t! Don\x92t leave me here with these people.'
Ross:,"b' Oh uh, I\x92m sorry. (Runs out.)'"
Rachel:,b' No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!'
Ross:,"b' Hi! I\x92m so glad you\x92re here, but it\x92s gonna be a while. I-I\nwished you\x92d called first.'"
Ross:,b' Oh good.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, what\x92s up?'"
Ross:,"b' Ma, you\x92re asking me to marry you?'"
Ross:,"b' Mom no, come on! Thank you.'"
Ross:,"b' N-no! Okay? We\x92ve been through this! We\x92re not gonna get married\njust because she\x92s pregnant, okay?'"
Ross:,"b' Mom, y\x92know what? I-I can\x92t deal with this right now. I\x92m\nsorry\x85'"
Ross:,b' Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters\nthe hallway.)'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!'"
Ross:,b' \x85she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I\x92m\nnot with Rachel.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. (Pause) Why aren\x92t you with Rachel?'
Ross:,"b' Are you kidding? Look, we\x92re not gonna be together just because\nwe\x92re having a baby. Okay?'"
Phoebe:,b' But y\x92know what? It just seems that you two belong together.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, stop it! I can\x92t deal with this right now. I have to go have a\nbaby.'"
Phoebe:,b' Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)'
Joey:,b' God. He\x92s crazy! Why doesn\x92t he want to be with Rachel?'
Phoebe:,b' I know!'
Joey:,"b' I mean seriously, she\x92s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she\nturned me down, but if she hadn\x92t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my\narms and\x85 (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven\x92t bummed you guys out like\nthis in a while have I?'"
Ross:,b' (To Rachel) Hey. Who\x92s that?'
Rachel:,b' New people.'
Ross:,b' What happened to the Disgustingtons?'
Rachel:,b' They\x92re having their baby! It\x92s not fair Ross we got here\nfirst! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave\nme a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.'
Ross:,"b' Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm,\nevil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!'"
Ross:,b' Yeah? Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Ooh! Ow!!'
Ross:,"b' Umm. Umm, I\x92m-I\x92m just gonna\x97(Closes the privacy screen.)'"
Ross:,"b' No-no, I\x92m\x85I\x92m sure no one was looking. Just want some\nprivacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)'"
Ross:,b' Just ignore them.'
Rachel:,b' Ross.'
Ross:,b' What? What?'
Rachel:,b' He\x92s looking at me.'
Ross:,b' (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m not crazy about babies. I\x92m crazy about us.'
Chandler:,"b' Look, we\x92ve always talked about having babies someday. I\x92m\nnot saying it has to be right now, but I\x92m starting to think that we can handle it.\nWe\x92re good. We\x92re really good.'"
Chandler:,b' But nothing has to happen until your ready.'
Chandler:,b' What?! It\x92s not right! We\x92re not ready to have a kid now!!'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m kidding. This is going to be fun.'
Chandler:,"b' We\x92re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler\nstops it.) Y\x92know I\x92m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.\nSo, when do you want to start trying?'"
Chandler:,b' Period math?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' Right here?'
Chandler:,"b' Wait a minute, it\x92s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and\nwe\x92re in a building that\x92s full of beds!'"
Joey:,b' Come on you stupid machine! Come on!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it ate your money?'"
Joey:,b' (looking at her) No.'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, I\x92ll see you downstairs then.'"
Joey:,b' All right.'
Phoebe:,b' All right.'
Joey:,b' Hey I got one! I got one!'
Phoebe:,b' Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can\x92t.) I-I\nhate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, it\x92s a long story. It\x92s kind of embarrassing. Let\x92s\njust say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about\nyou?'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, yeah.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh yeah! I-I would like that.'
Phoebe:,b' Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!'
Joey:,"b' (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)'"
Ross:,b' The nurse said they\x92re bringing in another woman.'
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn\x92t need to be; she\x92ll still\nhave the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some\nsupport.)'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s it. That\x92s it.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah it was.'
Phoebe:,"b' (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient\nI\x92m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he\x92s like\nearly to mid-thirties, very attractive.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?'"
Joey:,"b' (walks up) Uh, she\x92s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.'"
Joey:,b' Remoray. It\x92s Portuguese. We need that information; I\x92m a\ndoctor.'
Joey:,b' Damnit woman we\x92re losing precious time! Now do you want this\nman\x92s blood on your head?'
Phoebe:,b' Hands.'
Joey:,"b' Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my\nassistant described is staying in. He\x92s a patient of mine, I\x92ve been treating\nhim for years!'"
Joey:,"b' 816, thank you! '"
Phoebe:,b' Thank you. (Starts to exit.)'
Joey:,b' And what is his name?'
Phoebe:,b' (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (They start kissing.)'
Chandler:,"b' Okay. Uh, we\x92ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the\nlight switch and finds it\x92s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or\nturn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an\naerosol air freshener above her.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, 98.6. You\x92re gonna be fine.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that\x92s him! That\x92s\nhim!'"
Joey:,b' Great! Go get him.'
Phoebe:,"b' Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.'"
Joey:,b' (looks in the window) He\x92s not really my type.'
Phoebe:,"b' No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see\nwhat\x92s he like. People tell doctors everything.'"
Joey:,b' But you said he was this great guy!'
Phoebe:,"b' But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn\nout to be the biggest jerks.'"
Joey:,b' You do attract some stinkers.'
Rachel:,"b' Dr. Long, I\x92ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have\ncome and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am\nI dilated? Eight? Nine?'"
Ross:,b' Just three?! I\x92m dilated three!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what? I\x92m not waiting! I\x92m gonna push this\nbaby out! I\x92m doing it! I mean it\x92s what? Three centimeters? That\x92s gotta\nbe like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)'"
Ross:,b' Actually it\x92s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch\napart.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh stupid metric system!'
Rachel:,b' Oh for the love of God! '
Rachel:,b' Oh come on!!'
Joey:,b' Hi! I\x92m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need\nto ask you.'
Joey:,"b' I know, but I\x92m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr.\nWells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.'"
Joey:,"b' That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.'"
Joey:,b' Date of birth? '
Joey:,b' Age?'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. And uh, are you married.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment\nissues?'"
Joey:,b' (checking the list) Yes.'
Joey:,b' Oh that\x92s terrible. I\x92m-I\x92m really sorry.'
Joey:,b' Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?'
Joey:,"b' Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff\ny\x92know, sexually?'"
Joey:,"b' Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been\nwaiting four women, that\x92s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am\ndilated, have come and gone with their babies! I\x92m next! It\x92s my turn! It\x92s\nonly fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I\x92m going to\nsue you! Not this hospital, I\x92m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross)\nhe\x92s a lawyer!'"
Ross:,b' Uh Rach\x85'
Rachel:,b' Go get back on that case honey!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, well then bring her in.'"
Ross:,b' And yet somehow it\x92s true!'
Ross:,b' (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby\x92s ears!'
Ross:,b' (softly) Really?'
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Ross:,b' Oh there you go!'
Rachel:,b' I get it!'
Rachel:,b' Oh we-we didn\x92t.'
Ross:,b' No-no. We\x85'
Ross:,"b' Um uh\x85We\x92re-we\x92re just having this baby together but uh, uh\nthat\x92s all.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh well umm\x85we\x92re just not in that place, y\x92know? But\nwe\x92re very excited about this.'"
Rachel:,b' Just tell me how.'
Ross:,b' Sid you lucky deaf bastard.'
Phoebe:,b' What else? What else?'
Joey:,"b' Uh, well he\x92s 33.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh. Ah-uh.'
Joey:,b' A widower.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Joey:,"b' He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he\x92s not into anything weird\nsexually.'"
Phoebe:,b' Enter Pheebs.'
Chandler:,b' Should we tell Rachel there\x92s an empty private room right next\ndoor to hers?'
Chandler:,"b' Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!'"
Chandler:,"b' If it\x92s not, then there\x92s two of them. And that would mean\nit\x92s the end of the world!'"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,b' Oh hi.'
Rachel:,b' Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you\x92re trying to blow a\nSaint Bernard out your ass?'
Chandler:,b' Weirdest thing. Did I hear\x97(A nurse opens the privacy screen and\nChandler sees Janice)\x97Mother of God it\x92s true!'
Chandler:,b' Jan-Janice!'
Ross:,"b' Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.'"
Chandler:,b' Janice I didn\x92t even know you were pregnant! Who\x92s the\nunwitting human who\x92s essence you\x92ve stolen?'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay I\x92ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you\nrather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it?\nI\x92m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I\x92ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Relax, it\x92s not like we\x92re forking.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh that\x92s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have\nhad no babies! Why doesn\x92t she want to come out?'
Ross:,b' Y\x92know what I think it is? I think you\x92ve made such a nice home\nfor her over the last nine months that she just doesn\x92t want to leave.'
Rachel:,b' Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another\ncontraction as Dr. Long enters.)'
Rachel:,b' Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you\ngotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!'
Phoebe:,b' Y\x92know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as\nCliff sees something on TV.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in\nyour room?'"
Joey:,"b' (entering) Rachel\x92s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at\nhim.) Which is of no interest to me, I\x92m a neurologist.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Okay. I\x97Okay umm\x85this\x85I-I sent my friend Joey in\nhere to find out stuff about you. Umm y\x92know, if it helps you came off great. A '"
Joey:,b' Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)'
Phoebe:,"b' You\x92re right, that was wrong. I\x92m sorry. I\x92m so sorry.\nIt\x92s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff\nabout you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal\nstuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her\nbrother\x92s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh Joey, we\x92re trying to dial down the crazy.'"
Joey:,b' Right!'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, look we don\x92t, we don\x92t really know each other so it\nwould be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between\nus. And I don\x92t know about you but that doesn\x92t happen to me a lot.'"
Joey:,b' Me neither.'
Rachel:,b' 3-2-1 oh!!'
Rachel:,"b' I can\x92t. I can\x92t push anymore, I can\x92t.'"
Ross:,b' Sweetie you\x92re doing great.'
Rachel:,b' Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!'
Ross:,b' What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!'
Rachel:,"b' Don\x92t say, ""Oh my God!"" Oh my God what?'"
Ross:,b' What is that?'
Ross:,"b' Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?'
Ross:,b' Go!'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I can\x92t!'"
Ross:,b' Yes you can!'
Rachel:,b' I can\x92t!'
Ross:,b' Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let\x92s go!'
Rachel:,"b' I can\x92t. Please, you do it for me.'"
Ross:,b' No! Come on let\x92s\x97One more time! One final push! Ready?\n1\x852\x853! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking\nhim down.)'
Ross:,b' (from the floor) Keep pushing!'
Rachel:,b' Are you okay?'
Ross:,b' You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn\nand glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!'
Ross:,b' Oh! Oh! She\x92s upside down but she\x92s coming! She\x92s coming!'
Rachel:,b' Oh God!'
Ross:,b' Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she\x92s here.'
Ross:,b' Oh she\x92s\x85she\x92s perfect.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, she\x92s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where\x92d she go?'"
Ross:,b' Oh it\x92s okay. They\x92re just-they\x92re just wrapping her up.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Well be careful with her, she\x92s really tiny.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh.\nYeah. Oh, she\x92s looking at me. Hi! I know you.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, not yet.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.'"
Rachel:,b' Hello baby girl.'
Phoebe:,b' Can we come in?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, come in.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' There she is!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, she\x92s so beautiful.'"
Rachel:,b' Here. (Hands her to Monica.)'
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s incredible, I mean one minute she\x92s inside you and then\n47 hours later here she is.'"
Joey:,b' (taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y\x92know\nwhat I mean! She\x92s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees\nand\x85uh-oh.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from\nthe other hand so we\x92re good.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You\x92re so\ncute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won\x92t.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh nothing I\x85 Sorry, I just can\x92t stop crying.'"
Ross:,"b' The doctor says it\x92s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus,\nyou-you\x92re sleep deprived.'"
Rachel:,b' So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don\x92t see you weeping\nbecause you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)'
Joey:,b' What\x92s the matter now?'
Rachel:,b' I was reliving it.'
Phoebe:,b' Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)'
Chandler:,"b' So, do you know what you\x92re gonna call her yet?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, wait a minute it\x92s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was\nso original! '"
Ross:,"b' Uh actually, we-we\x92ve narrowed it down to two names.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, and y\x92know what? I love them both, so why don\x92t you just\npick one and that\x92ll be it.'"
Ross:,"b' Wow! Umm, okay uh\x85everyone\x85this\x85is Isabella. (Rachel starts\ncrying.) What?'"
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s not her name! I\x92m sorry, she just doesn\x92t feel\nlike an Isabella.'"
Chandler:,b' So then I guess Ferdinad is out.'
Joey:,b' What was the other one Ross?'
Ross:,"b' Umm, Delilah.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.'
Ross:,"b' So I guess we\x92re back to uh, Baby Girl.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yay!'
Rachel:,b' Well what are we going to do?'
Ross:,"b' Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going\nto be.'"
Chandler:,b' You do?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh no, it\x92s gonna be named after some snack or baked good\nisn\x92t it?'"
Rachel:,b' Well tell us! What are they?'
Rachel:,b' And if it\x92s a girl?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, just tell us! We\x92re not gonna want it!'"
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don\x92t\nwant it.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh honey, but you love that name.'"
Chandler:,b' That was amazing.'
Chandler:,"b' And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.'"
Rachel:,b' Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your\nbreath away doesn\x92t he?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I\x92m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)'"

Besides y\x92know what?\nI-I\x97Maybe we won\x92t be alone, \x91cause lately I-I\x97things have been\nhappening between me and Ross, y\x92know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this\nkiss. Y\x92know? So it might be the\x85the beginning of something.'"

Ross:,b' Huh?'
Rachel:,b' Umm\x85that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something\nhuh?'

Rachel:,b' (pause) Right.'
Ross:,b' I mean we don\x92t want to go down that road do we?'
Rachel:,"b' No! No, of course not. No. That\x92s why I brought it up. (Pause) They\ndidn\x92t have any sodas?'"

Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry, for the last time, why aren\x92t you two together\nagain? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you\x92re not in that place.\nWhich would be fine, except you totally are.'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s\x85it\x92s complicated okay?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah that\x92s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a\nchild together. There is no right answer.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, we\x92ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together,\nand then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It\x92s just if-if we got together again\nand it didn\x92t work out\x85I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking\neverything\x97(Starts to cry.) Oh that\x92s\x85now me. What do they put something in\nthe water in this place? Since Rachel and I we\x92re doing really, we\x92re doing\nreally well right now.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might\nwreck it.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, exactly.'"
Phoebe:,b' Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you\x92ve wanted since you\nwere fifteen.'
