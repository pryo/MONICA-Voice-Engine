Chandler:,"b' (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick\nso that he\x92s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I\x92m gonna be moving out so '"
Joey:,b' Right! And when is that due?'
Chandler:,b' First of the month.'
Joey:,b' And that\x92s every month?'
Chandler:,"b' No, just the months you actually want to live here.'"
Joey:,b' Ahhh.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)'"
Joey:,b' (looking at it) Oh my God!!'
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this\nwhole me moving out on thing, so why don\x92t I just\x97why don\x92t I just cover\nyou for a while?'"
Joey:,b' No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity\x85anymore.'
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s not charity, Joe\x85'"
Joey:,"b' No! Forget it! Okay\x97I mean thanks, but I\x92m done taking money\nfrom you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what\x92s next? Come on.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay uh, here\x92s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)'"
Joey:,b' This is how much we pay for electric?!!!'
Chandler:,"b' Uh, yeah.'"
Chandler:,"b' So, we\x92ll do the rest of the bills later then?'"
Phoebe:,b' So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?'
Chandler:,"b' No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn\x92t\ntake it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, how much do you think he needs?'"
Chandler:,"b' I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y\x92know?\nBut I have to trick him into taking it so I won\x92t hurt his pride.'"
Phoebe:,b' Why don\x92t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and\nput on little skits. Whatever you want.'
Chandler:,b' Well that would help the pride thing.'
Chandler:,b' Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?'
Chandler:,"b' Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?'"
Phoebe:,"b' And also, my birthday.'"
Phoebe:,b' What a mean thing to say! I would '
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we\x92d do nothing.'"
Ross:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys\nwould come over and watch it.'"
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know Ross, not if you\x92re gonna talk about how you gave\nup a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.'"
Ross:,b' I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!'
Rachel:,"b' (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Well and clearly not a minute sooner.'
Rachel:,b' Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her\nopinion on what I should wear tonight.'
Phoebe:,"b' My God, I can\x92t get a minute of peace around this place.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! Monica\x92s just gonna kill you.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, yeah, I know.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, what you\x92re wearing is fine for that.'"
Rachel:,b' Surprise!!'
Rachel:,"b' No, no don\x92t get mad because look\x97this is what happened. So\nI-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!""\nRight? But you '"
Phoebe:,b' I have plans.'
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s right.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hurry! Monica\x92s gonna make you pack! She\x92s got jobs for\neveryone! Now, it\x92s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the\ndoor.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, but for the last time.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, but-but I can\x92t do it.'"
Joey:,b' (quietly) I\x92ve got Ben.'
Ross:,"b' Because, because I\x92ve got Ben.'"
Chandler:,b' He\x92s at a dinner party.'
Ross:,"b' Of course he is! What, do you think I\x92d just use my son as-as an\nexcuse? What kind of father do you think I am?'"
Ross:,b' (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.'
Joey:,b' Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I wish I\x92d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh that\x92s okay. Hey, actually in a way it\x92s kinda nice. Me,\nbringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!'"
Chandler:,"b' Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.\nWhat do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?'"
Joey:,"b' What, are you crazy? You haven\x92t beaten me once since my injury\nplagued \x9297 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.'"
Chandler:,b' Yes it would. What do you say to $50?'
Joey:,"b' Okay, you\x92re on.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, let\x92s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohhhhhh, look it\x92s the roller blades.'"
Rachel:,b' You remember when we got these?'
Rachel:,b' I guess you weren\x92t there. (They hug.)'
Phoebe:,"b' You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the\ntime\x85 (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don\x92t remember?'"
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry Pheebs, I guess I\x92m just really said that I\x92m\nleaving.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, this doesn\x92t have to be so sad though. Y\x92know? Maybe\ninstead of just thinking about how much you\x92re gonna miss each other, you should like\nthink of the things you\x92re not gonna miss.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Come on, there\x92s gotta be something.'"
Rachel:,b' I have one.'
Phoebe:,b' Good! Great! You can go first.'
Rachel:,"b' Uh well, I guess I\x92m not gonna miss the fact that you\x92re '"
Phoebe:,"b' Good that\x92s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y\x92know? Does\nRachel move the phone pen?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, good. There you go. Doesn\x92t anyone feel better?'"
Rachel:,b' You get your messages!'
Rachel:,"b' So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler?\nOr your mom?'"
Phoebe:,b' Great! It worked! No one\x92s sad.'
Joey:,"b' (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That\x92s like 500 bucks you owe me!\nWhoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)\n$500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there\x92s nothing in the fridge.)\nWhoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one\ngoal, $1,000.'"
Joey:,b' You serious?'
Chandler:,b' Oh yes!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, get ready to owe me!'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Okay, here we go. Ready?'"
Chandler:,b' No! No! No! No\x97(Joey looks at him)\x97one can beat me.'
Chandler:,"b' See? Now, that\x92s why only the little fake men are supposed to do\nall the kicking.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, your brother. Score!'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, I\x92m just over here with Ben. I thought we\x92d say hi.'"
Ross:,"b' Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has\ncreated out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn\x92t feel like talking right now.\nHe\x92s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember\nthe roller blades?'"
Rachel:,"b' You know what else I\x92m not gonna miss? ""I\x92m Monica. I\nwash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!""'"
Rachel:,"b' ""I\x92m Monica, I don\x92t get phone messages from interesting\npeople. Ever!""'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey! I call her!'
Rachel:,"b' ""Oh my God, I can\x92t find a boyfriend! So I guess I\x92ll\njust stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner\nreservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)'"
Chandler:,b' Still broken?'
Joey:,"b' This sucks man! The last night you\x92re here and I lose the two most\nimportant things in my life, the foosball table and $500.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a\nlittle uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)'"
Joey:,"b' Nah, not my game.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, uh, how about, how about\x97y\x92know what? We could play a\nnew game. A new game, it\x92s fun.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, what\x92s it called?'"
Chandler:,b' Cups.'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know how to play Cups.'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it\x92s really easy and\nreally, really fun.'"
Joey:,b' All right.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens,\nwhat do you have?'"
Joey:,b' A two and a five.'
Chandler:,"b' Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!'"
Joey:,b' Really?!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah! Okay, let\x92s play again. (He deals out two cards each\nagain.) What do you got?'"
Joey:,b' A four and a nine.'
Chandler:,b' You\x92re kidding right?'
Joey:,b' No. Why?'
Chandler:,b' Well that\x92s a full cup! (Pays him again.)'
Joey:,b' Damn! I am good at Cups!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you,\nbecause she\x92s the one who\x92s leaving. It\x92s harder for her!'"
Phoebe:,"b' I know, I took it hard too.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m unpacking!'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that\npicture straight?'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what? You\x92re the one who wants to make this big\nchange and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to\nleave?!'"
Rachel:,b' Well it\x92s mine too! What else you got?!'
Rachel:,"b' Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over\nMonica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, how are you guys doing?'"
Rachel:,b' Great! Monica\x92s moving!'
Rachel:,b' Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts\nchasing Rachel around the table.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what\x92s going on here. Okay,\nyou guys\x85 '"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, deep-deep-deep down!'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m just mad!'"
Phoebe:,b' Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)'
Chandler:,b' You win.'
Joey:,"b' Well, what did you have?'"
Chandler:,"b' It doesn\x92t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That\nmy friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.'"
Chandler:,b' Not 700 exactly?'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' Double it! (He does.)'
Joey:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.'"
Joey:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, I didn\x92t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the\ndoubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your\ntotal to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don\x92t get to excited because that\x92s not\ngonna happen unless you get\x97No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of\nclubs. Of course, any card would\x92ve won. Chandler pays him.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on\nChandler.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey you guys, I don\x92t mean to make things worse, but umm, I\ndon\x92t want to live with Rachel anymore.'"
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re just so mean to each other! And I don\x92t want to end up\nlike that with Rachel. I still like you!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, Phoebe that\x92s fine because I\x92m not moving.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh really? Like what Monica?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah, good start Mon.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah and you stretch \x91em out with your big old clown feet.'
Phoebe:,b' What else?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.'
Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know, I don\x92t want you to be cold.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it\x92s gonna be fine.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay Rachel, I can\x92t '"
Rachel:,"b' But honey, I think she\x92s moving in with Chandler.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh that\x92s right. You\x92re still set on that?'
Ross:,"b' (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how\x92s the packing\ngoing? (Listens) Ben? He\x92s fine. Yeah, he\x92s right\x97Oh my God! (He looks over\nat the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt\nthere son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,\nit\x92s a pumpkin. I\x92ll come pack.'"
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' What\x92s wrong?'
Joey:,"b' Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500\nto him in Cups!'"
Chandler:,b' Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!'
Joey:,"b' The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross\ngets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was\ngetting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin\x92 Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn\x92t\neven get half a cup! Nothin\x92!!'"
Chandler:,b' Oh man!!'
Joey:,"b' And he never played before either! Y\x92know what I think? I think\nbeginner\x92s luck, '"
Chandler:,"b' All right, let\x92s play one more hand! One more!'"
Joey:,"b' No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I\x92m serious this time!\nIn-in fact, look, there\x92s a\x97I wanna give you something. And let me give it too\nyou know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want\nyou to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y\x92know, thank you for being such a\ngreat roommate.'"
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t take the big white dog! You love it!'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s him, not it!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, but wait\x97what if I bought it from you, y\x92know? And your\nnice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?'"
Joey:,"b' Wait a second, I see what you\x92re trying to do here! You-you\x92re\ntrying to give me money again!'"
Chandler:,b' When did I try to give you money?'
Joey:,"b' Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to\ngive some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last\nnight together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now\nout of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that\nyou\x92re okay.'
Joey:,b' I '
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh God! This is silly, I\x92m gonna see you in a couple of hours!\n(They hug again.) '"
Rachel:,b' Bye house!'
Rachel:,b' Bye Mon.'
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Chandler:,b' I know. (He kisses her.)'
Chandler:,b' No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)'
Chandler:,b' Sure!'
Chandler:,b' I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.'
Ross:,b' And now you want that money back.'
Chandler:,b' Exactly.'
Ross:,"b' Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the\nfake Ben.)'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s not a real game! I made it up!'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.'"
Chandler:,b' At a fake game!!'
Ross:,"b' Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I\x92d be glad to play\nyou for it. But I should warn you, I am '"
Chandler:,b' Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.'
Ross:,b' No.'
Chandler:,"b' Hmm, let\x92s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards\nand shrugs.)'"
