Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hi guys! '
Ross:,"b"" Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? """
Phoebe:,"b"" Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this\nagain!' """
Rachel:,"b"" What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? """
Rachel:,b' Since when? '
Joey:,"b"" Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means\n'It is you'. """
Chandler:,"b"" Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing\nalcoholics and complaining about them to you'. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,\nI already am'. """
Rachel:,b' And everybody knows this? '
Joey:,b' Yeah. Cushions the blow. '
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to\nsleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. """
Ross:,"b"" That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send\nour dog off to live on a farm. """
Ross:,"b"" What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had\nthis unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-\nit w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! """
Chandler:,"b' ""So how does it feel knowing you\'re about to die?"" '"
Joey:,"b' ""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you\'ll have to\nlive with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."" '"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, that was really good! '"
Joey:,"b"" Thanks! Let's keep going. """
Chandler:,"b' Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"" '"
Joey:,"b' ""I just wanna go back to my cell. \'Cause in my cell, I can\nsmoke."" '"
Chandler:,"b' ""Smoke away."" '"
Chandler:,b' I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. '
Joey:,b' What? '
Chandler:,b' Relax your hand! '
Chandler:,b' Not so much! '
Joey:,b' Whoah! '
Chandler:,b' Hey! '
Joey:,b' Hey! '
Chandler:,"b' Alright, now try taking a puff. '"
Chandler:,b' Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. '
Joey:,"b' No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. '"
Chandler:,"b"" It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. """
Chandler:,"b"" Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been\nmissing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. """
Joey:,"b"" Y'miss it? """
Chandler:,"b' Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..\nGod. (He continues to smoke.) '"
Joey:,"b"" That's ridiculous! """
Ross:,b' Can I use.. either thumb? '
Rachel:,"b"" (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!\n(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced\ntea. I'm getting pretty good at this! """
Rachel:,b' (leaving to serve others) Good for me! '
Joey:,"b"" Y'okay, Phoebe? """
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. """
Phoebe:,"b"" It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up\ntheir monthly, you know, STATEMENT- """
Ross:,b' Easy. '
Phoebe:,"b"" - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. """
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, Satan's minions at work again... """
Phoebe:,"b"" Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. """
Joey:,b' What are you talking about? Keep it! '
Phoebe:,"b"" It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like\nstealing. """
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know\nwhat I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was\nhappy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,\nnot-not-mine'... """
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this\ngiant karmic debt. """
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, what are you doing? '"
Ross:,b' What is this?! '
Chandler:,"b"" I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! """
Chandler:,b' And this- is my reward! '
Ross:,"b' Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last\ntime you quit. '"
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, so this time I won't quit! """
Chandler:,"b"" All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in\nPhoebe's coffee.) """
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! """
Rachel:,"b"" This Alan again? How's it goin'? """
Joey:,b' So when do we get to meet the guy? '
Chandler:,b' What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..\nSorry. '
Rachel:,"b' Well, then can we meet him? '"
Joey:,"b' Let it go, Ross. '"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. """
Joey:,"b' You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! '"
Ross:,"b' Hey, Pheebs. '"
Phoebe:,"b"" 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have\ncredited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and\nhope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -"""
Rachel:,b' What bank is this? '
Joey:,"b"" (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here! """
Ross:,"b"" ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I\ncan't do this, can't do this. We loved him. """
Rachel:,b' And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.) '
Joey:,b' Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. '
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! '"
Ross:,b' ...What shoe? '
Phoebe:,"b"" From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked\nsmile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' """
Ross:,b' ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future\nboyfriends will be measured. '
Rachel:,"b"" What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. """
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.\nYou know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression) """
Ross:,"b' You know what I like most about him, though? '"
Ross:,b' The way he makes me feel about myself. '
Ross:,b' Well.. '
Joey:,b' Alan. '
Ross:,"b' He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where\nBugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,\nsecond base-Alan, third base-... '"
Rachel:,"b' I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. '"
Chandler:,"b' Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about\nsoftball.. '"
Ross:,b' What? '
Rachel:,"b"" Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. """
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. """
Chandler:,b' I personally could have a gallon of Alan. '
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, Lizzie. '"
Phoebe:,b' I brought you alphabet soup. '
Phoebe:,"b' Yes. But I left in the Ys. \'Cause, y\'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh,\nI also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) '"
Phoebe:,"b' No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? '"
Phoebe:,b' I know. '
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, that's fine, no. """
Phoebe:,"b"" No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? """
Phoebe:,b' Okay. '
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I'm fine. """
Phoebe:,b' Huh! '
Ross:,b' A '
Phoebe:,"b' I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,\nlike this tiny little hitch-hiker! '"
Chandler:,"b"" Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? """
Phoebe:,"b' Does, um, anyone wanna see? '"
Rachel:,"b"" It's worse than the thumb! """
Chandler:,"b' Hey, this is so unfair! '"
Chandler:,"b"" So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking\nisn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with\nthat snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those\nflaws, why can't you accept me for this? """
Joey:,b' ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? '
Rachel:,"b' Well, I-I could live without it. '"
Joey:,"b' Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her\nhair? '"
Ross:,"b"" Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. """
Joey:,"b' Oh, (Imitating Ross) ""you do, do you""? '"
Ross:,"b"" You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. """
Rachel:,"b' ""Indeed there isn\'t""... I should really get back to work. '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. """
Rachel:,"b' Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. '"
Joey:,b' Do you have any respect for your body? '
Ross:,"b"" Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? """
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your\nemphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. """
Rachel:,"b"" (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to\nspeak to you. """
Chandler:,"b"" Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she\ntold you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's\nnot that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that\nbefore. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.) """
Rachel:,"b"" (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good. """
Ross:,b' If only he were a woman. '
Rachel:,b' Yeah. '
Chandler:,"b"" Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for\nthirty years it'd be talking too. """
Ross:,"b"" Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) """
Chandler:,"b' Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was\nwrong? '"
Rachel:,"b"" I think he's across the hall. """
Ross:,"b"" (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. """
Chandler:,"b"" (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. """
Ross:,"b' Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? '"
Phoebe:,b' Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? '
Ross:,"b' Hey, I might! '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars\nfor the thumb. """
Phoebe:,"b' And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the\nuniverse?! '"
Joey:,"b"" (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going\non? """
Joey:,b' Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. '
Rachel:,"b' Uh, Joey.. '"
Joey:,"b' Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.) '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Wait, wait, I'm getting a """
Phoebe:,b' There it is! '
Ross:,b' Is there somebody else? '
Rachel:,"b"" We didn't change.. """
Joey:,"b"" So that's it? It's over? Just like that? """
Phoebe:,"b' You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about\nsomeone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) '"
Joey:,b' Okay! '
Ross:,"b"" Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they\nwere. """
Chandler:,"b"" (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! """
Rachel:,"b"" (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming\nup- I wanted him to meet my family- """
Ross:,"b"" Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. """
Rachel:,b' Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. '
Ross:,b' Yeah. He could row like a viking. '
Ross:,"b"" So how'd it go? """
Phoebe:,b' Did he mention us? '
Ross:,"b"" You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her\nforehead.) """
Chandler:,"b"" ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. """
Chandler:,"b"" (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've\ngotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! """
Phoebe:,"b"" (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven\nthousand dollars! """
Chandler:,"b' (returns) Yeah, alright.'"
