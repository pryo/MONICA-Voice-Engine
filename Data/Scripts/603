Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his\nbreath for almost four minutes! '
Joey:,b' (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo\x97you trying to kill me?!'
Rachel:,"b' (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, what?'"
Rachel:,b' Well since I\x92m movin\x92 out and-and you\x92re so\nbeautiful\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Oh!'
Rachel:,b' \x85how about I move in with you?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?'"
Phoebe:,b' My roommate.'
Rachel:,b' You have a roommate?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, Denise. Denise! '"
Joey:,"b' Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is\nshe cute?'"
Chandler:,"b' Pheebs, I don\x92t understand. How can you have a roommate that none\nof us know anything about?'"
Phoebe:,b' Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her\nall the time! '
Joey:,"b' Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin\x92 uh, I\x92m gonna have an extra room\nover at my place\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, that\x92s true.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, why don\x92t you move in with me? It\x92ll be great! We could\nstay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday\x92s right?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, yeah I think I\x92m gonna find my own place.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday\x92s was just our thing man!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.'"
Phoebe:,b' You didn\x92t tell her did you?'
Ross:,b' No. '
Phoebe:,"b' Of course not, because you\x92re in love with her.'"
Ross:,"b' I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so\nI eh, didn\x92t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.\nI-I just comforted her, as a friend.'"
Phoebe:,"b' What do you mean, comforted her?'"
Ross:,"b' It\x92s nothing, I just gave her a hug.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s also a sign of friendship.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of\nRoss\x92s cookie.)'"
Ross:,b' (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?'"
Ross:,b' S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ninety percent of a women\x92s pheromones come out the top of her\nhead! That\x92s why, that\x92s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love\nwhen they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you\x92re a\nscientist. '"
Ross:,"b' I was hugging her as a friend. It\x92s not my fault her-her hair got in\nmy face, she\x92s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh\x85coconutty. (Phoebe\nraises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn\x92t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe\nit means I have feelings for coconuts!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all\nright? Rachel\x92s not in the same place you are.'"
Ross:,"b' (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in\nlove, then she '"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I didn\x92t understand that, but y\x92know, maybe that\x92s\n\x91cause you were speaking the secret language of love! '"
Joey:,"b' Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.'"
Chandler:,b' Who was it?'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message.""\nJeez! (Exits.)'"
Chandler:,b' Sure!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it\ncould be a game room, y\x92know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like '"
Chandler:,"b' Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting\nidea. Let\x92s discuss it before we reject it completely.""'"
Chandler:,"b' So, that\x92s it?'"
Chandler:,b' Which is why '
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t have anything against the beautiful guest room,\nespecially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I\x92m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful\nguest room. (Exits.)'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, what\x92s up?'"
Chandler:,"b' Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.'"
Joey:,"b' But you\x92re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out\ntoday. (Shows him the paper.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (reading the ad) ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,\nnon-ugly."" Nice!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah? I just figured y\x92know, after living with you it\x92d be an\ninteresting change of pace to have a female roommate, y\x92know? Someone I can learn\nfrom, someone-someone who\x92s different than me. And what\x92s more different than\nme; a guy who\x92s '"
Rachel:,"b' Pheebs, I have to ask you\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Shhhhhh! I\x92m swamped right now.'
Rachel:,b' You\x92re just staring into space.'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, I\x92m trying to move that pencil. (There\x92s a pencil lying\non the table.)'"
Rachel:,b' This one? (Picks it up.)'
Phoebe:,b' It worked!'
Rachel:,"b' Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I\ncan afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and\nstarts to read it.) ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It\x92s\njust, there is nothing! The city\x92s full!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) ""Two bedroom,\ntwo bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay\x85"" Oh, yeah, but it\x92s on\nthe ground floor.'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah! Why?'
Ross:,"b' Okay, there\x92s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he\x92s going\non a dig for like two years and he\x92s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,\nyou interested?'"
Rachel:,b' That sounds great! I\x92d love to live at Warren\x92s!! I love\nWarren! Thank you!'
Ross:,"b' Don\x92t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that\nerupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.\n(Rachel just looks at him.) Here\x92s Warren\x92s number.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank\nyou! '"
Ross:,"b' Okay, you go grab it!'"
Phoebe:,b' I saw it.'
Ross:,b' I don\x92t know what you\x92re talking about.'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, I\x92m talking about that which you already know but won\x92t\nadmit. You love her again; you re-love her!'"
Ross:,"b' Look, I do not re-love her.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I can\x92t believe you won\x92t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just\npromise me that you won\x92t do anything stupid.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, we\x92re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?'"
Rachel:,"b' (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already\nsubletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I\x92m never gonna find anything.'"
Ross:,b' You can live with me.'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Are you serious?!'
Ross:,b' Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)'
Rachel:,b' I would love to live with you Ross; that\x92s-that\x92s great! Thank\nyou!'
Ross:,"b' Well, I\x92m-I\x92m just glad I could, y\x92know, help you out.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow! I\x92m-I\x92m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,\nnot stupid.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was\ngonna be homeless. You just saved me! You\x92re my hero!'"
Ross:,"b' Hero, I uh, I don\x92t know\x97well, all right.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses\nhim on the cheek and exits.) '"
Ross:,"b' Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You\x92re gonna say things now,\naren\x92t ya?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No. No, I won\x92t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing\nhappened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her\nand he said he didn\x92t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And\nthat\x92s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,\nthat\x92s a lie.'"
Chandler:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,"b' Hi, listen, I\x92m sorry about before. I don\x92t need to have a\ngame room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn\x92t get\ngirls, and now I '"
Chandler:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,b' Ohh.'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s a great idea! We can '
Chandler:,b' We don\x92t have to come up with this now.'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what? Why don\x92t we think about changes we can\nmake in the living room?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I mean we\x92re gonna have to move around some furniture to\nmake room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)'"
Chandler:,b' Is that a problem?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, that\x92s cool. Then I\x92ll just bring them both over.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything\nhere is yours! I\x92ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!'"
Chandler:,b' In the game room!'
Chandler:,b' All right! That\x92s fine! That\x92s fine! I won\x92t bring over\nthe chairs! I won\x92t bring anything over! I wouldn\x92t want to ruin the ambiance\nover here at Grandma\x92s place!! (Storms out.)'
Joey:,"b' (exiting from Chandler\x92s room with the new roommate) Everything on\nyour application looks really good\x97Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your\nfriends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa!! Now look, don\x92t be just blurtin\x92 stuff out. I want you to\nreally think about your answers. Okay?'"
Chandler:,b' (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential\nroommate) Hi! I\x92ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)'
Joey:,"b' Oh don\x92t listen to him, he\x92s just some guy who really wants the\napartment, but I don\x92t think he\x92s gonna get it.'"
Chandler:,b' Why did you take the shower curtain down?'
Joey:,b' That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I\x92m very safety\nconscious.'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica\x92s and she and Chandler\nhad a big fight and they\x92re not moving in.'"
Ross:,"b' What do you mean, they\x92re not moving in? They-they\x92re still\nmoving in right?'"
Rachel:,"b' No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.'"
Ross:,b' What?! Over a stupid room!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I\x92m also really psyched\n\x91cause I don\x92t have to move in here!'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no, yeah no, that part\x92s great!'"
Ross:,"b' What\x92s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a\nroom?! I mean, that is so silly!'"
Ross:,"b' Well, apparently not, and I can\x92t just stand by and watch two people\nI care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the\nsilliness!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, why don\x92t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks\nhim and he joins in.)'"
Ross:,"b' (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I\x92ve known you\nboth a long time, and I\x92ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as\nyou\x92ve been since you\x92ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away\nover a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for\nthe love.'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s laughter.'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t know.'
Ross:,"b' Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I do.'"
Ross:,"b' And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don\x92t ya?'"
Ross:,b' (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!\n(Storms out.)'
Rachel:,"b' No-no, I\x92m staying put.'"
Rachel:,"b' Why, where are you going?'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey Rach!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' You\x92re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in\nagain. That\x92s great news right\x97I mean for them. Right?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh wow.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah. Y\x92know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really\nappreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don\x92t you think it\x92s\ngonna be weird?'"
Ross:,"b' Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, because of us! Because of our history.'"
Ross:,b' No!'
Rachel:,b' No?'
Ross:,"b' No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you\nstill in that place?'"
Rachel:,b' No! Not at all!'
Ross:,b' Good! Me neither! So it\x92s not a problem. We\x92re just two friends\nwho happen to be roommates.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.'"
Ross:,b' Really?! We are?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah! I\x92m gonna have a boyfriend, you\x92re gonna have a\ngirlfriend\x85'"
Ross:,b' Ohh! That would be great.'
Rachel:,"b' But y\x92know what, if you think it\x92s gonna be okay we\x92ll\njust work out a system. Y\x92know, it\x92ll be like college, I\x92ll hang a hanger\non the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I\x92m gettin\x92 lucky.""\n(Laughs.)'"
Ross:,"b' (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn\x92t think of\nthat.'"
Ross:,b' So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it\x92s a '
Chandler:,"b' He\x92s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!'"
Ross:,"b' No, I-I-I\x92m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you\nstart fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y\x92know you break up!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn\x92t about the room, this is\nabout what the room\x85represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel\x92s\nroom) could destroy you!!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, I'm not so worried."""
Ross:,"b' Fine! It\x92s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed\nattempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last\ntime.) I just don\x92t want to see you guys break up! Which you '"
Chandler:,b' Of course!'
Chandler:,b' Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.'
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Chandler:,b' Oh my God! Someone\x92s killed Square Man!'
Chandler:,b' Oh that\x92s so sweet! I want to show you something too!'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?""'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs\nand hang it over our bed. Because, that\x92s you and I together! Merge!'"
Chandler:,b' Really?!'
Phoebe:,b' (singing)'
Phoebe:,"b' Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please\ngive me money so I can buy a computer.'"
Ross:,"b' (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?'"
Rachel:,"b' Umm, well let\x92s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.'"
Ross:,b' Fighting?!'
Rachel:,"b' No, the other thing. I really think it\x92s great they work things\nout.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. There\x92s no breaking them up, is there?'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street\nand make a copy?'"
Ross:,b' Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)'
Rachel:,"b' Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy,\nthere\x92s no turning back.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m-I\x92m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I\nchange my mind. (She exits)'"
Joey:,"b' Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good\nidea?'"
Ross:,b' I\x92ve been back and forth.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you\nknow it you\x92re right where you don\x92t want to be! Back together!'"
Ross:,"b' Ehh, I don\x92t, I don\x92t think so. She\x92s already talked about\ny\x92know, dating other guys.'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s not gonna work out! Then she\x92s gonna come home all weepy\nand you\x92ll be tellin\x92 her, ""Oh that\x92s okay. You\x92ll find\nsomeone."" And then, '"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well, m-maybe you\x92re right.'"
Joey:,"b' I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you\nagain! Now, is that what you want?'"
Ross:,b' Is that what I want?'
Phoebe:,"b' (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.'"
Joey:,"b' Here she comes. Hold on, I\x92m gonna make your life much easier.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, well the place was closed. I\x92ll just copy it later.'"
Joey:,"b' Or not. Uh, Rach, why don\x92t you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)'"
Ross:,"b' Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!'"
Joey:,"b' No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no\x85 It\x92s okay, I mean I\x97look Rach, I\nknow I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday\x92s thing, but we don\x92t have\nto do that!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a\nminute, unless you\x92re thinking about Naked Wednesday\x92s.'"
Joey:,"b' Thursday\x92s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!'"
Joey:,b' (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!'
Joey:,"b' Come in. Thanks for comin\x92 back, umm, okay there have been a lot of\npeople interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and '"
Joey:,"b' Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure\nour personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I\x92m gonna say a word\nand then you say the first thing that comes to mind.'"
Joey:,b' Okay! Here we go. Pillow.'
Joey:,b' Very good! Okay. G.'
Joey:,"b' Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.'"
Joey:,"b' Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but\x97bye-bye! (He ushers her\nout the door.)'"
