Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey! Wow, it '"
Phoebe:,"b' (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it\x92s just\nI\x92m so pregnant that I\x97my guitar doesn\x92t fit anymore. So I thought\n\x91til I\x92m not, I\x92m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds '"
Chandler:,b' All right.'
Phoebe:,b' Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) '
Joey:,"b' Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!'"
Phoebe:,"b' I know! I know, and I\x92ve only been playing for like an hour!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey! What are you doing here?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, well, don\x92t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my\nuterus.'"
Chandler:,b' Wouldn\x92t that be Frank the III?'
Phoebe:,b' Wow! That\x92s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock\x92s a little fast, uh, we have 17\nminutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, uh, you can ignore that.'"
Ross:,"b' Uhh, believe me when he\x92s older, he\x92ll understand.'"
Ross:,"b' I\x92ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,\nSusan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is\nCarol and Susan.'"
Ross:,"b' Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so\x85'"
Ross:,b' Oh come on! That\x92s-that\x92s\x85 true.'
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a\nbook) and found nothing! I want a name that\x92s really like, y\x92know strong and\nconfident, y\x92know? Like-like Exxon. '"
Chandler:,"b' Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.'"
Joey:,"b' Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, I\x92m-I\x92m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name\nstarting with ""The.""'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey\x92s your pal. Joey\x92s your\nbuddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they\x92re hanging out with\nJoey.""'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what, if you\x92re gonna do that, if you\x92re\ngonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn\x92t think so.) Oh,\ncome on! Chandler\x92s funny, sophisticated, and he\x92s very loveable, once you get\nto know him.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh well, hey, Joey\x92s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if\nyou need him, he\x92ll be there.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a\nlittle late, but-but, he\x92ll be there. And he\x92ll bring you some cold soda, if\nwant you need him for is that you\x92re really hot.'"
Joey:,b' What do ya say? What do ya say?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey\nand Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I\ndon\x92t\x97maybe I\x92ll just name him The Hulk.'"
Joey:,b' I knew I shouldn\x92t have mentioned it! That\x92s what I wanted to\nname my kid!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time\ntonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She\x92s holding two frilly,\nlace nighties.)'"
Rachel:,b' Sorry. I\x92m so exited! I\x92ve been waiting for this for months! I\ngot my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I\x92m making him a '
Rachel:,b' What am I making him by the way?'
Rachel:,b' I thought I was making him filet mignon? '
Rachel:,"b' Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.'"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' So uh, Emily called last night\x85'"
Chandler:,b' And '
Ross:,b' Turns out them Emily is just '
Phoebe:,"b' God, Susan is so fun!'"
Ross:,"b' Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six\nmonths before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: ""My friend Susan is so smart. My\nfriend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.""'"
Chandler:,b' You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?'
Ross:,"b' Hey, they\x92re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!\nY\x92know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful\x97didn\x92t\nyou see '"
Joey:,"b' No, but I\x92m gonna!'"
Chandler:,b' Hi! Hi! You\x92re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.'
Ross:,b' How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married\nher!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I definitely. I don\x92t like the name Ross.'"
Ross:,b' What a weird way to kick me when I\x92m down.'
Phoebe:,b' No! No! I-I meant for the baby!'
Ross:,b' Oh. What\x92s wrong with Ross?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, it\x92s just y\x92know that something like this would never to\nlike The Hulk, y\x92know\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Actually that-that\x92s not true, in '"
Phoebe:,"b' So, I decided I\x92m definitely going to go with either Joey or\nChandler.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named\nChandler.'"
Chandler:,b' Raymond Chandler.'
Joey:,b' Someone you didn\x92t make up!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, there are '"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, that guy really hurt us.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it\x92s like\ny\x92know, Chanoey?'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he\x92ll\nnever be President. There\x92s never gonna be a President Joey.'"
Joey:,"b' All right look man, I didn\x92t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is\nthe stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It\x92s not even a name; it\x92s barely\neven a word. Okay? It\x92s kinda like chandelier, but it\x92s not! All right?\nIt\x92s a stupid, stupid '"
Chandler:,"b' Wow, you\x92re, you\x92re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.'"
Joey:,"b' I\x92m sorry man, I didn\x92t\x97I\x92m-I\x92m sorry. I\x92m\nsorry. (Goes over and comforts him.) '"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,b' So I guess it\x92s Joey then!'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!'"
Rachel:,b' (taking a bite) Hmmm!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh I know, my God, this is so\x97this rice is so\x97I am so good.'"
Rachel:,"b' (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I\x92m sorry. They used to\nlive here; sometimes they migrate back over.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.'"
Joey:,"b' (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings\nthem inside.)'"
Rachel:,"b' All gone! So, farm birds, huh?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. So, can I serve you a little of\x97What? What? What? (She sees\nthat Joshua isn\x92t relaxed.)'"
Rachel:,"b' But, they\x92re across the hall! I mean that\x92s two doors away, it\nwould take them a long time to peck their way back over here.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, y\x92know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I\nmean we could pack all this stuff up and y\x92know go to your apartment.'"
Rachel:,b' Your parents\x92?'
Rachel:,b' Ohh.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah that works.'
Ross:,b' (opening the door.) Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."" I asked\nhim if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do, he\nsaid, ""No."" So, he\x92s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a\ndustpan.)'"
Ross:,"b' So umm, any word from Susan?'"
Ross:,"b' Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I\ndon\x92t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.'"
Ross:,b' Am I?!'
Ross:,b' '
Ross:,"b' Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,\nSusan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y\x92know? Say-say they\x92re\ncoming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,\nthey\x92re laughing, y\x92know, someone innocently touches someone else\x85\nThere\x92s electricity, it\x92s new. It\x92s exciting. Are you telling me there\nisn\x92t even the slightest possibility of something happening?'"
Ross:,b' OH MY GOD!! I didn\x92t really believe it until you just said it!!'
Rachel:,b' Wow! This place is fabulous!'
Rachel:,"b' Whoa-whoa, there\x92s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this\nplace must\x92ve been a real babe magnet.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?'"
Rachel:,"b' That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?'"
Rachel:,b' Ah.'

Rachel:,"b' I know, I can do more than cook.'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh! It\x92s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their\nhands.) Hello. '
Rachel:,b' Hello.'
Rachel:,"b' What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is\nnot\x97that\x92s-that\x92s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see\nand-and, this is a real dress actually. It\x92s-it\x92s, they\x92re-they\x92re\nwearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people\nrespond, and then I report back to my superiors at '"

Rachel:,b' Yes.'
Joey:,"b' Dude, I am sorry about what I said!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no, you\x92re right, it is a ridiculous name!'"
Joey:,b' It\x92s not that bad.'
Chandler:,"b' Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.'"
Joey:,"b' So, you\x92re just Bing?'"
Chandler:,b' I have no name.'

Phoebe:,"b' Bye, Gene.'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s Clint! '
Joey:,b' What\x92s up with Gene?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled\nwater down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!'
Rachel:,"b' No, it\x92s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there\nheads in agreement.)'"
Ross:,"b' (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she\nand Susan are going to a poetry reading together! '"
Rachel:,b' So?'
Ross:,b' So! Poetry? Susan\x92s gay! They\x92re being gay together!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, wake up!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, Carol really messed you up!'"
Ross:,b' Excuse me?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,\nsycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don\x92t know what sycophant means,\nbut the rest is right.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, I don\x92t know what you\x92re talking about, I am not a crazy,\njealous person.'"
Rachel:,b' Huh.'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' She\x92s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out\nabout Mark and there was nothing going on.'"
Ross:,b' It does not!'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, all right, so up until \x9192-93 he was very trusting, then\n\x9294 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!'"
Rachel:,b' Absolutely! Absolutely!'
Ross:,b' This is '
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. The \x9292 Ross wouldn\x92t.'
Ross:,"b' Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.'"
Rachel:,"b' What\x97yeah\x97what, y\x92know what? I hope Emily '"
Phoebe:,b' Drum roll.'
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?'"
Joey:,"b' Nah, you\x92re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good\nBarney.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down\nto the courthouse.'"
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re actually going through with this?'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,\nit\x92s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with\nwomen\x85 So, as of 4 o\x92clock tomorrow, I\x92m either gonna be Mark Johnson or\nJohn Markson.'"
Phoebe:,"b' You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got\nto stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact\x97yes, (To Joey) I\x92m, I\x92m sorry. I\nknow you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I\x92m-I\x92m, I\x92m\ngonna, I\x92m gonna name the baby Chandler.'"
Chandler:,b' (pleased) Really?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. Thanks.'

Chandler:,"b' Bye, Pheebs!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, bye! '"
Chandler:,b' Ha! Ha! Ha!'
Joey:,b' Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby\nChandler.)'
Ross:,b' Nice luggage.'
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I missed you too.'"
Ross:,b' (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)'
