Joey:,"b' Oh, nothing, no. It\x92s an acting exercise, I\x92m practising my fake\nlaugh.'"
Joey:,b' What-what\x92s so funny?'
Chandler:,b' Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.'
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b' No-no, why don\x92t you hang on to that one.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, that\x92s like the least fun game ever.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x92m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that\nis going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking\npatch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake\nlaughs.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on, it\x92s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two\nweeks straight and she hasn\x92t smoked since.'"
Ross:,b' Pffhah.'
Rachel:,b' (to Ross) What\x92s your problem?'
Ross:,"b' Nothing, it\x92s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh right, \x91cause you always pull your pants down at the count of\nthree and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have\nto dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men."""
Chandler:,b' Or what my Father called Thursday night.'
Ross:,b' Here you go.'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, y'know what, I didn\x92t want cinnamon on this."""
Ross:,"b' Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his\nhand.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!! '
Phoebe:,b' Frank! Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' What are you doing here?'
Phoebe:,b' What happened?'
Phoebe:,"b' But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?'"
Phoebe:,b' Your getting married?!'
Phoebe:,b' My little brother\x92s getting married!!'
Phoebe:,b' Do I?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I do, yeah.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I would\x92ve bet good money that he\x92d be the first one\nof us to get married."""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, isn\x92t it fantastic?'"
Phoebe:,"b' What, he\x92s 18.'"
Ross:,"b' Exactly, it\x92ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.'"
Chandler:,b' Always illegal Joe.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m a big surprise.'"
Chandler:,"b' If that doesn\x92t keep kids in school, what will?'"
Ross:,b' And so now you guys are gonna be married?'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!! Great!'
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you\x92re ready for that?'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh good! Okay. \x91Cause you were acting like you didn\x92t.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, that shouldn\x92t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all\nI meet are eligible straight men.'"
Rachel:,"b"" (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean\nthat ain\x92t a pretty picture in the morning, y\x92know what I mean. That wig all in\ndisarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. """
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I know, I know, that this is Frank\x92s life, (walks behind them,\nthey turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don\x92t want to\nbe all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it\x92s sick and wrong!"""
Ross:,"b' Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" No-no, oh, I\x92m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts\nsticking it\x92s tongue down my little brother\x92s throat! """
Joey:,"b' Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" But, I mean, do you think he\x92s gonna enjoy it when he\x92s up to\nhis elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not\nfair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and\nit-it\x92s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it\x92s not good home economics."""
Joey:,"b' Well, have-have you told him how you feel?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes. Not out loud.'
Ross:,"b' Pheebs, if you don\x92t tell him, soon he\x92s gonna be married, and\nthen you\x92re gonna hate yourself.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he\x92s gonna hate myself. I mean\nlook at him and his Mom, I can\x92t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk\nhim out of it.'"
Ross and Joey:,"b' No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them,\nand turns them back to face her.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.\nDo you want me to lose everything? Everything?!'"
Ross and Joey:,b' No.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I\x92m gonna go get Frank. (exits)'"
Joey:,"b' So, we\x92re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,\n\x93Hey, let\x92s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,\x94 remember? And then, and\nthen, you turn to me and say, \x93Nah, let\x92s just hang out at your place.\x94\nWell, that was a nice move dumb ass. '"
Rachel:,b' I think you should definitely go out with this guy.'
Rachel:,"b' Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on '"
Rachel:,b' All right.'
Chandler:,"b' (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just\ncarry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?"""
Rachel:,"b' Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what, pretty good."""
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Chandler:,"b' Good! I haven\x92t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and\nconfident, that is a stunning blouse.'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Chandler:,b' Thanks'
Rachel:,"b' Hey Mon, let\x92s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems\nreally nice, and that check thing was adorable.'"
Chandler:,b' What check thing?'
Chandler:,b' (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete\x85 (quickly grabs a magazine\nand opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?'
Chandler:,b' Who\x92s he huggin\x92?'
Chandler:,b' This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that\nprogram!'
Rachel:,b' We use it!!'
Chandler:,b' There you go!!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, Monica\x92s gonna go out with a millionaire. '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, I can\x92t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is\njust so exciting.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah, sure, that too.'"
Chandler:,b' (to the girls who are staring at him) What?'
Ross:,b' All we\x92re saying is don\x92t rush into anything.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, come on, think about it. You\x92re 18, okay, she\x92s 44, when\nyou\x92re 36, she\x92s gonna be 88.'"
Joey:,"b' Look, the point is, there\x92s a lot of women out there you haven\x92t\neven had sex with yet!'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, he-he\x92s right, he\x92s right. This is your time y'know, yeah,\nyou\x92re young, you\x92re-you\x92re weird, chicks dig that."""
Joey:,"b' Yeah, in a poem maybe.'"
Ross:,"b' No the man\x92s right, that\x92s what I had with Rachel.'"
Ross:,"b' No, I ah, I slept with someone else.'"
Ross:,b' It didn\x92t.'
Joey:,"b' Now, wh-what, what is that like?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, yeah.'"

Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I know. It\x92s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know what, forget it. It\x92s ruined. """
Phoebe:,"b' Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?'"
Phoebe:,"b' What umm, what happened?'"
