Rachel:,b' What?'
Joey:,b' They did it right there on the couch. '
Joey:,b' Hey Ross!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b"" (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have\na scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting\nmarried! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!"""
Chandler:,b' Sorry man.'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down\non the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK\nFOOD!!!!!!!"""
Chandler:,b' Did they teach you that in your anger management class?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and\nEmily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the\nLouisiana Purchase?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Pheebs, I don\x92t think anyone's mad about that."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Exactly! Because it's in the past!"""
Joey:,b' (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.'"
Chandler:,"b' I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)'"
Chandler:,"b' I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is\nMonica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, sir.'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, that was my work laugh.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one\ntoo."""
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,b' Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! '
Chandler:,b' '
Chandler:,"b' Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park\nand hit rocks at\x85bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey\nRach, do you have a tennis racquet?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back."""
Chandler:,"b' Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)'"
Rachel:,b' (To Monica) Hey!'
Rachel:,"b"" What's up?!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my\nfriend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with\nyou?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh y'know what, we don\x92t have to talk about work. We can talk about\nanything!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!"""
Rachel:,b' Nothing! You go!'
Rachel:,"b"" Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do\nhave a lot of work to do so if-if\x97are you sure there's just not anything else?"""
Rachel:,"b"" No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you."""
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, then what happened?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!"""
Ross:,"b"" (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"""
Phoebe:,b' Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This\nis not over!'
Ross:,b' No! No! No!'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b"" I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and\nnow it's all covered in-in\x85 (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!"""
Joey:,b' (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?'
Ross:,"b"" Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."""
Joey:,b' Really?'
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."""
Joey:,"b"" Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and\nstuff."""
Ross:,"b"" That's okay, Joe."""
Joey:,"b"" All right, let's go Pheebs."""
Ross:,b' (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.'"
Chandler:,b' Let them win one.'
Chandler:,"b"" You're not even giving them a chance!"""
Chandler:,"b' Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?\n(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oopsey, missed it!'"
Chandler:,b' Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed\nracquet from his bag.)'"
Chandler:,b' It was my racquet.'
Chandler:,"b"" If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow\nnight."""
Chandler:,"b"" Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."""
Joey:,b' Maybe we should check the trash chute.'
Rachel:,"b"" Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute."""
Joey:,"b"" That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."""
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' There he is!'
Ross:,"b"" Just, y'know out."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"""
Phoebe:,b' What were you doing?'
Ross:,"b' I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.'"
Rachel:,b' You walked around all night in the city by yourself?'
Joey:,b' (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.'
Ross:,"b"" Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do\nwhatever I want!"""
Joey:,b' He hooked up!! Tell us about her!'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah! No that's what I was thinking."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)"""
Ross:,"b' Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' You two will have very hairy children.'
Ross:,"b"" Okay, I didn't know you would say that."""
Rachel:,b' Ross! Janice?!'
Joey:,"b"" All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He\nobviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind."""

Ross:,b' I '
Joey:,b' Damnit Phoebe!!'
Rachel:,"b' (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during\nour entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even\nwhen I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.'"
Rachel:,"b' I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I\'ll just\ntell Rachel that I\'m doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said,\n""Laundry? Is '"
Rachel:,"b"" Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."""
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b"" All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and\nChandler."""
Joey:,"b' All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-hmm.'
Joey:,"b"" All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes\nthe waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And\nthey're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)"""
Phoebe:,b' Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!'

Phoebe:,b' Ohhh.'
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey guys!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'

Joey:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,b' Are you serious?!'
Ross:,"b"" Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to\nme. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It\nis amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention."""
Phoebe:,"b"" You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We\x85"""
Joey:,b' And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!'
Phoebe:,"b"" (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an\nold Wonton!"""
Joey:,"b' Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, tough call.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' Just a little bit of sugar.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, you get used to it.'"
Chandler:,"b"" So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"""
Chandler:,b' Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b"" Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, I just\x85'"

Rachel:,b' Sure! Why?'
Joey:,"b"" Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."""
Rachel:,"b"" What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps\nlying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right\nnow!"""
Chandler:,"b"" (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist\njokes now?!"""

Chandler:,"b' Man, she is really gullible.'"
Ross:,b' Thanks!'

Ross:,"b"" I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I\nhope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real\nlaugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?"""
Chandler:,b' Why would I be mad?'
Ross:,"b"" Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't\nuh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or\ngirls they're related to."""
Chandler:,"b"" (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you\nknow what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do!
