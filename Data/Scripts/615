Rachel:,"b' Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow!'
Joey:,b' (To Ross) '
Phoebe:,b' No! Barry and Mindy.'
Joey:,"b' Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel)\nWho-who\x92s Barry and Mindy?'"
Rachel:,b' Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best\nfriend.'
Joey:,"b' Ohh-oh, wasn\x92t he cheating on you with her?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her\ninstead of me.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else.\nIsn\x92t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean\nhow different would my life be?'"
Ross:,"b' I know what you mean, I\x92ve always wondered how different my life\nwould be if-if I\x92d never gotten divorced.'"
Phoebe:,b' Which time?'
Ross:,"b' The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn\x92t realized she\nwas a lesbian.'"
Joey:,b' (starts to imagine it) I can\x92t. I keep seeing it the good way.'
Ross:,"b' I\x92d bet I\x92d still be doing my kara-tay. (That\x92s karate,\nhe\x92s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of\nkara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y\x92know, not doing anything else\nphysical.'"
Chandler:,b' Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.'
Chandler:,b' Sure I would!'
Chandler:,"b' What, you guys really think that I\x92m that shallow?'"
Ross:,"b' No, I just think Monica was that fat.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, imagine if I never got fired off '"
Chandler:,b' What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I\x92d probably be\nwriting for the '
Phoebe:,b' What if I had taken that job at '
Ross:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,b' '
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a\nknack for stocks.'"
Rachel:,b' Well why didn\x92t you take the job?'
Phoebe:,"b' Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true.\nSo I thought y\x92know that if I\x92d work with stocks, I\x92d have to live in a\nbox, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we\x92d still\nhang out?'"
Ross:,b' (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?'
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Rob Tillman!'
Ross:,"b' No-no. It\x92s-it\x92s me, Ross!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. Ross Tillman.'"
Ross:,"b' No, no-no, Ross Geller.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, of course Monica\x92s brother!'"
Ross:,b' Yeah. Right.'
Rachel:,b' Wow! How are you?!'
Ross:,"b' Good-good, I\x92m-I\x92m married. (Shows her his ring.)'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh! Me too!'
Ross:,b' Is-isn\x92t it the best?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it\x92s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of\nmarriage.) So, umm how\x92s Monica?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she\x92s right down the\nstreet, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, I would love too.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah? Oh-oh, she\x92d be so excited!'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh! Okay!'
Ross:,b' Come on! (They start to leave.)'
Rachel:,"b' Oh wait, don\x92t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine)\nBusty Ladies?'"
Ross:,"b' No, it\x92s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I\ndon\x92t\x85'"
Rachel:,b' (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.'
Ross:,b' (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.'
Rachel:,b' But! Don\x92t you have to give him his money back?'
Ross:,"b' Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here\nyou go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let\x92s go see Monica!'"
Joey:,"b' So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?'"
Joey:,b' (not impressed) Wow!!'
Joey:,"b' Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering, depressed) Hey.'"
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was\nfunny, just not ""'"
Chandler:,b' Was his question what\x92s more boring than him?'
Joey:,"b' Hey man, look sorry about that '"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.'"
Joey:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,b' Ehh.'
Joey:,"b' That\x92s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant,\nwould-would you take money from her?'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s great! That would be great! Let\x92s do that!'
Chandler:,b' I could use the money; it could give me time to write.'
Joey:,b' Oh right great! Welcome aboard!'
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Joey:,"b' All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don\x92t need\nany assistance in there, take a break!'"
Chandler:,b' All right!'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh that\x92s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly\ngrabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the\ncigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it\nhits 50! 5-0, it\x92s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it\x92s okay. It\x92s okay,\nyou\x92re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.'"
Ross:,b' Hey Mon! '
Ross:,"b' Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She\x92s not quite sure of that\none.)'"
Ross:,"b' And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah.'
Ross:,b' And that\x92s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)'
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon\x92s\nparty. I played you one of my songs, y\x92know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah. Right. So now, are\x97do you, do you still do music?'"
Ross:,"b' Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime!\nI\x92ll play you one of my other\x85'"
Rachel:,b' (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from '
Rachel:,b' (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?'
Chandler:,b' Well it\x92s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy\nschedule and the fact that he\x92s not real.'
Ross:,"b' (To Rachel) Hey-hey, '"
Rachel:,b' He\x92s coming over! He\x92s coming over!'
Joey:,b' (holding a plate of what looks like '
Rachel:,b' (giggles and can\x92t look at him) Hi!'
Joey:,b' (shaking Rachel\x92s hand) Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I\nwatch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even\nthough she tired to kill you\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Well, it\x92s always nice to meet the fans.'"
Rachel:,b' Ah!'
Joey:,b' (turning and whispering to Monica) She\x92s not crazy is she?'

Joey:,b' (entering) Hey there you are!'
Chandler:,"b' Uh-oh, it\x92s my boss!'"
Joey:,"b' All right, here\x92s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this\ngoing to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I\x92m\ndelivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)'"
Chandler:,b' (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins.\nTeach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' (yelling from Monica\x92s room) No-no!! No!!'
Phoebe:,"b' No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13\nmillion dollars.'"
Chandler:,b' But the '
Phoebe:,"b' What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can\x92t call my office\nthey\x92ll kill me! I can\x92t call my clients they\x92ll kill themselves! Great,\nnow my chest hearts.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can\x92t breathe.'"
Chandler:,"b' Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! '"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left\narm?'"
Phoebe:,b' Then yes that is what I\x92m having. (Takes another puff of the\ncigarette.)'
Ross:,"b' Come on Pheebs, it\x92s not that bad! Y\x92know most people would be\nexcited if they didn\x92t have to work for a couple of weeks.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Most people don\x92t like their jobs, I '"
Chandler:,"b' I always thought having a heart attack was nature\x92s way of\ntelling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you\x92re not gonna die. I mean, you are\n'"
Phoebe:,b' (To Ross) So what\x92s going on with you?'
Ross:,"b' Well umm, I\x92ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.'"
Phoebe:,b' Still going through that dry spell with Carol?'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' How long has it been since you had sex?'
Ross:,"b' Well, last weekend\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh that\x92s not so bad.'
Ross:,b' \x85will be two months\x85'
Phoebe:,b' That is.'
Ross:,b' \x85since I stopped trying.'
Phoebe:,b' Maybe you need to spice things up a little.'
Ross:,b' What-what do you mean?'
Phoebe:,"b' I don\x92t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could\neat stuff off each other\x85'"
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, dirty talk, m\xe9nage \xe0 trois, toys\x85'"
Ross:,b' Wow!'
Phoebe:,b' Roll playing\x85 You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner.\nYou could be the pirate; she could be the wench!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, I think I got it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and\nyou\x92re-you\x92re-you\x92re rolling around naked on the trading floor and\neverybody\x92s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, ""Bring me\nfood."" Two is, ""I\x92m with a girl, bring us food."" Three is,\n""I\x92m lost and I can\x92t find food.""'"
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?'"

Joey:,"b' All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?'"
Rachel:,"b' (laughs) Wow! Umm, y\x92know, I-I would really love to, but I-I\nshouldn\x92t.'"
Joey:,"b' Why? (In Drake\x92s voice.) Why can\x92t the world stop turning, just\nfor a moment? Just for us?'"
Rachel:,"b' (awestruck, then not) Isn\x92t that a line from the show?!'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake\x92s voice) I may have said those things\nbefore but, I never truly meant them. Until now.'"
Rachel:,b' That\x92s a line from the show too!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, you watch too much TV.'"
Chandler:,"b' (approaching) Here you go Joe, here\x92s the freshly squeezed orange\njuice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)'"
Joey:,"b' Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there\x92s pulp in that. (Hands it back.)'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' I thought we talked about this. I don\x92t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp\nisn\x92t juice. All juice, okay?'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh my God, I\x92m sorry, I\x92m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.)\nRachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.'"
Joey:,b' (To Chandler) Iced tea.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, anything for you sir?'"
Joey:,b' (To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?'
Rachel:,"b' (mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.'"
Joey:,"b' (To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth\nindicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares\nat him.) You\x92re gonna throw that juice at me, aren\x92t ya?'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)'
Ross:,"b' So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower\nthere.'"
Ross:,"b' Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things\nup a little.'"
Ross:,b' Carol our sex life is\x97it\x92s just not working\x85'
Ross:,"b' Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don\x92t we get some shoes on\nya, huh? Hey, why don\x92t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!\nYay!!'"
Ross:,"b' Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our sex life\x85 I was thinking, maybe I\ndon\x92t know, we could try some-some new things. Y\x92know? For fun?'"
Ross:,"b' Well I don\x92t know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up?\n(Carol\x92s shocked and obviously doesn\x92t like that idea.) Umm, some people eat\nstuff off one another. (Carol doesn\x92t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, y\x92know\nwe-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a\nthreesome.'"
Chandler:,b' Who sold a story to '

Joey:,b' Oh my God! That\x92s great! Congratulations! What\x92s the story?!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh you wouldn\x92t uh, care. It\x92s just a stupid comic book\nstory.'"
Joey:,b' Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!'
Chandler:,"b' Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he\ndoesn\x92t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his\nassist\x97as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him\nmilkshakes that can\x92t have lumps in them.'"
Joey:,b' Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that\none? \x91Cause I think I read it!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to\nhis apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?'"

Rachel:,"b' Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn\x92t be\nall this rules and restrictions! Y\x92know, people should be able to sleep with who ever\nthey want, whenever\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Oh what do you know? Virgin!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects. '"
Phoebe:,b' No! It\x92s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!'

Phoebe:,b' Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!'
Ross:,"b' J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that '"
Phoebe:,b' Thank God.'
Ross:,"b' (To Monica) Yeah, she\x92s fired.'"
Rachel:,b' (very relived) Oh! Thank God!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay! (She picks up the phone, Joey\x92s phone number, and starts to\ndial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi, Joey! It\x92s Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow\nnight. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.'"

Ross:,"b' Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to\nanother page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone\x92s\nbeen doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y\x92know, just-just talking about it is getting me\nkinda\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben\x92s asleep.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)'
Ross:,"b' Hey, Pheebs!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, how\x92s it going?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I\x92ve got to get out of this bed, I\x92m going crazy here.\nCrazy!'"
Phoebe:,"b' What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!'"
Ross:,"b' She doesn\x92t know she was fired yet, does she?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, the doctors say it may kill her.'"
Phoebe:,b' What are you two girls whispering about over there?!'
Chandler:,b' (To Ross) But '
Ross:,"b' Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you\nshould start think about getting a different job.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!\n(Points at Ross.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Listen Phoebe, he\x92s right. People are not supposed to have heart\nattacks at 31.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I know! But if I didn\x92t work there, what else would I do?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!'
Chandler:,"b' Uh, what about y\x92know the massage thing? That never gave you a\nheart attack.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked\npeople for chump change\x97ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, I mean it\x92s just so realistic!'"
Joey:,"b' I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on\npolls. You\x92ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.'"
Rachel:,b' Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)'
Joey:,"b' (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you\x97ready for a refill?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I probably shouldn\x92t\x97so I will! (Joey starts making her\nrefill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It\x92s like it\x92s\nraining!'"
Joey:,"b' Pretty cool, huh? But if you\x92re thinking you can put a fish in there\nand it wouldn\x92t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you\x92d be wrong.'"
Rachel:,"b' Umm, can I use your bathroom?'"
Joey:,"b' It\x92s uh, right through there. (Points.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. (Starts to go.) God y\x92know, if someone told me a week ago\nthat I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani\x92s apartment\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, life\x92s pretty great isn\x92t it?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, it sure is!'"
Ross:,"b' We\x92re really gonna do this, huh?'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out\nat\x85 (A knock on the door interrupts him.)'"
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' I\x92m-I\x92m Ross by the way.'
Ross:,b' How hot is this?!'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m sorry you\x92re here with me instead of Roger.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I could make it seem like he\x92s here. (Imitates him.)\n""Here\x92s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn\x92t add the second\ncous until 1979."" (Mumbles something further.)'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,b' What was tonight?'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?'
Chandler:,b' With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica\nshrugs.) Oh my God!'
Chandler:,b' Four different women! I\x92ve had sex way more times!'
Chandler:,b' Nine.'
Chandler:,"b' Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect\nguy?'"
Chandler:,b' Hey that\x92s what I tell girls about me.'
Chandler:,b' No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen\nfor you.'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)'
Chandler:,b' So was I.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, you\x92re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know\nwhere Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I\npretty much have to make it up on my own.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! Tell me something Joey\x97(She falls off the couch)\x97Whoa! I\njust fell right off the couch there.'
Joey:,b' Yeah you did.'
Rachel:,b' Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.) '
Joey:,b' Here you go. Let me ask you a question.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,b' When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?'
Rachel:,"b' Wow! I can\x92t, I can\x92t feel my hands.'"
Joey:,"b' Come, come here. '"
Chandler:,b' We can\x92t do this.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of\npressure on me, y\x92know? Because you\x92ve been waiting a very long time and I\nwouldn\x92t want to disappoint you.'"
Chandler:,b' I do like that.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for\ntonight, right?'"
Chandler:,b' Stop it! We\x92re doing this! Let\x92s do it!'
Chandler:,b' Okay! (They both get up.)'
Chandler:,b' I have some moves.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, let\x92s just forget it.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Chandler:,b' Oh yeah.'
Chandler:,b' (sexily) Yeah?'
Chandler:,b' Oh my God!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Morning!'
Rachel:,b' (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' (groans) Oh God. Oh I can\x92t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw\nup!'
Joey:,b' Well he actually saw you a little bit too.'
Rachel:,"b' Noo! Oh God we did\x97we didn\x92t, we didn\x92t uhh\x85'"
Joey:,"b' No! No! No, not after seeing that.'"
