Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! I can\x92t believe my little brother is married!'
Phoebe:,"b' You guys, why didn\x92t you tell me you were eloping?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse? '"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, a year and a half ago I didn\x92t even know I had a brother, and\nnow I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay.\nStop it, don\x92t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?'"
Phoebe:,b' (shocked) That\x92s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy\nboat.'
Joey:,"b' (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (He\x92s\nwearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.'
Rachel:,b' But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, you-you know what I meant.'"
Chandler:,b' So what job did you get Joe?'
Joey:,"b' Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, how can you be a tour guide, don\x92t you have to be a dinosaur\nexpert or something?'"
Joey:,"b' No, not really. They give you all the information, it\x92s uh, it\x92s\nlike memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) ""And on your left, you have\nTyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh actually Joey, it\x92s the Cretasous period.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!'"
Phoebe:,"b' And! And, they\x92re gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And!\nAnd, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)'"
Ross:,b' My God!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah'
Joey:,b' You\x92re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ewww! And ""Oh no!"" It\x92s\x97they just want me to be the\nsurrogate. It\x92s her-it\x92s her egg and her sperm, and I\x92m-I\x92m just the\noven, it\x92s totally their bun. '"
Joey:,b' Huh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to\nthink about? I\x92m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.'"
Chandler:,b' You\x92re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a '
Rachel:,"b' Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are\nthings to think about.'"
Phoebe:,b' I know!'
Ross:,"b' Pheebs, you\x92re talking about putting your body through an awful lot,\nI mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it\x92s all for somebody else!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, what\x92s your point?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, the stuff I just mentioned.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! I don\x92t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the\nfirst time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a\x85keeper.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim\nfurniture."""
Joey:,"b' No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we\x92ll be supportive\nlike crazy.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who\x92s had a baby. Like\nyour mom?'"
Phoebe:,b' My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yeah, sure, it\x92s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.'"
Rachel:,b' You guys are really right\x85there aren\x92t you?'
Chandler:,b' Yes. Right where?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, we haven\x92t had sex yet. Okay, what\x92s the big\ndeal? Y\x92know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the\nnext level.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Chandler that is so nice.'"
Ross:,b' That is really nice\x85lying! No way is that the reason!'
Rachel:,b' Why? Just because you\x92re not mature enough to understand something\nlike that?!'
Chandler:,"b' No, he\x92s right, I\x92m totally lying.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, Kathy\x92s last boyfriend was Joey.'"
Ross:,b' And you\x92re afraid you won\x92t be able to\x85fill his shoes.'
Chandler:,"b' No, I\x92m afraid I won\x92t be able to make love as well as him.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, and I was saying the actual words.'"
Chandler:,"b' We share a wall! So either he\x92s great in bed, or she just likes\nto agree with him a lot.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Just go for it Chandler.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, you should, really.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, all right, I\x92ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But\nI\x92m just doing it for you guys.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.'"
Joey:,"b' Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a\nfossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display\ncases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave\n\x91Hi\x92 to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at\nwork. (Ross does the old ""Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your\nmouth trick."") Okay, moving right along. Come on.'"
Phoebe Sr:,b' It\x92s open! Come in!'
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe Sr:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I\x92m late.'"
Phoebe Sr:,"b' Oh, that\x92s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! You really go all out when you\x92re expecting company.'
Phoebe Sr:,"b' No, I was working on my pottery.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn\x92t know that you did\x85pot.'"
Phoebe Sr:,"b' Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and\nerotica.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, erotiery!'"
Phoebe Sr:,b' Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just\nthought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.\nY\x92know\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe Sr:,"b' I really don\x92t think it\x92s a very good idea, Phoebe.'"
Phoebe:,b' Why not?'
Phoebe Sr:,"b' Well, because you\x92d be giving up a baby, and I-I really\ndon\x92t\x97I don\x92t know if there\x92s anything I can say that could make you\nunderstand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the\ncouch.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don\x92t-don\x92t hurt the\npuppy.'
Phoebe Sr:,"b' No-no-no, the-the puppy\x92s yours.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I get a puppy!!'"
Phoebe Sr:,"b' Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.'"
Phoebe:,b' Why?'
Phoebe Sr:,"b' I realise I don\x92t have any right to start get all parenty on you\nand everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn\x92t paying attention and is busy\nmimicking the puppy.) uhh\x85 Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,\nit\x92s very important. '"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe Sr:,"b' I mean, I know what I\x92m talking about. I gave up two babies, and\nI only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible\nit is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every\nsingle day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it\nwould be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy\nagain, and not listening) I really shouldn\x92t have given you the puppy first.'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, I\x92m sorry.'"
Joey:,"b' Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I\x92m-I\x92m saving this for my\nfriend Ross.'"
Joey:,b' Doctor? Wow! I didn\x92t know he had a nickname.'
Joey:,"b' Well, how-how come?'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s crazy.'
Joey:,"b' I-I think everybody\x92s pretending they don\x92t hear you. Anyway,\nlook, I don\x92t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is\none of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I\x92m telling you, he '"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s okay, I\x92m cool over here. I\x92ll catch up with you\nlater, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)'"
Ross:,"b' (entering) Hey, uh, I\x92m really, really sorry about what happened in\nthe cafeteria today.'"
Joey:,"b' It\x92s no big deal. Hey, y\x92know, you do what you gotta do. Right?'"
Ross:,"b' But hey, it\x92s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides '"
Joey:,b' Whatever.'
Ross:,"b' It\x92s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where\nyou work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other\nchefs, right?'"
Joey:,"b' Look, Ross, really it\x92s-it\x92s no big deal. Y\x92know you wear a\nwhite coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can\x92t be friends at work, then so\nbe it. Y\x92know, hey I understand. Y\x92know? Hey, when I\x92m in a play and\nyou\x92re in the audience, I don\x92t talk to you, right? So it\x92s y\x92know,\nit\x92s uh, it\x92s cool. I\x92ll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, when we\x92re in the audience he doesn\x92t talk to us, but he\ndoes wave.'"
Chandler:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,b' Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, y\x92know what, I think it\x92s time for puppy to go out again.\nCome on, let\x92s go to the balcony.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, the street. Come on, let\x92s go to the street. Ooh, listen,\ndon\x92t go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, yes, we had the sex.'"
Chandler:,"b' It was fine, y\x92know? But she didn\x92t agree with me as\nstrongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, I\x92m all\nright with it.""'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a\nwoman, y\x92know, I know where everything goes, it\x92s always nice. But I need to\nknow what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! Somebody\x92s killing her in\nthere!""'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, you don\x92t have to draw an actual wo\x97whoa! She\x92s\nhot!'"
Chandler:,b' (shocked) There are seven?!'
Rachel:,"b' Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.'"
Chandler:,b' (Points to one) That\x92s one?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, y\x92know-y\x92know what, I was looking at it upside down.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that\ncould\x92ve meant.)'"
Chandler:,b' That-that\x92s bad?'
Rachel:,b' Well if you go to '
Chandler:,b' Well you might if it were anything like 7!'
Rachel:,"b' Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)'"
Ross:,"b' Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I\x92m having my lunch at this table, here\nin the middle. I\x92m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he\x92ll\nsit with me.'"
Joey:,b' (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table\nand they shake hands.)'
Ross:,"b' Y\'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something\nunnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y\x92know\nwhat I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in\nblue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"" Now, I say we shed these-these\ncoats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat\nand throws it down.) I\x92m Ross! I\x92m divorced, and I have a kid!'"
Joey:,"b' (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) I\x92m Joey! I\x92m an\nactor! I don\x92t know squat about dinosaurs!'"
Ross:,"b' All right, there you go!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, good-good for you.'"
Ross:,"b' Wow, Rhonda.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, okay, Scott!'"
Phoebe:,"b' My mom\x92s gonna be here any minute. I can\x92t do this, I\ncan\x92t give him up. Yes\x97no, I can. I don\x92t want to. But I can. No.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oo, I can\x92t watch this, it\x92s like '"
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, it was only okay.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, I can\x92t do this. My mom was right. If I can\x92t-if I\ncan\x92t give him up, then there\x92s no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and\nAlice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give \x91em\x97a\nkidney!'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Ooh! Umm!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, why don\x92t you?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, yeah!'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, I\x92m really okay with this. Y\x92know why? \x91Cause look at\nthem, and I made that, so\x85 I know it\x92s gonna be like a million times harder to\ngive up a baby but, oh my God, it\x92s gonna feel like a million times better, right? I\nwanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.'"
Phoebe Sr:,b' (entering) Hi! What\x92s going on?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided\nI\x92m gonna carry their baby.'"
Phoebe Sr:,b' But Phoebe\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is\na totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.'"
Phoebe Sr:,"b' Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it\x92s just\x97that was my\npuppy.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh!'
Rachel:,b' It depends on who asked.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Mon, sure.'"
Rachel:,b' Yes. (Pause) You\x92re not asking are you?'
Rachel:,b' Yes! Totally!'
