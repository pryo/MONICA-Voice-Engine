Chandler:,"b' Do you think that there\x92s a town in Missouri or some place called\nSample? And ah, as you\x92re driving into town there\x92s-there\x92s like a sign,\nand it says \x93You\x92re in Sample.\x94 (He says it like urine sample.)'"
Rachel:,b' How\x92d it go with Pete?!'
Joey:,b' Tell us!'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, so, so you went to Pete\x92s...'"
Ross:,b' What happened?'
Joey:,b' (to Billy) So you\x92re the gynaecologist?'
Phoebe:,"b' So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?'"
Rachel:,"b' So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or\nshould I say Mrs. Monica Becker?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No-no-no oh, keep your name, don\x92t take his name.'"
Phoebe:,b' Well then '
Rachel:,b' Why?! What is it?'
Phoebe:,b' (intrigued) Oh?!'
Phoebe:,b' (disappointed) Oh.'
Joey:,"b' And it\x92s not fake, it\x92s totally brutal.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s two guys in a ring, and the rules are:\n\x93They\x92re '"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.'"
Ross:,"b"" Huh, what\x92s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross\x92s\nmouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic)\nThanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"""
Joey:,"b' What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, but there\x92s two in martini, soo everybody '"
Chandler:,"b' Oh it\x92s Bing, sir. I\x92m sorry , I was just ah...'"
Ross:,"b' (on phone) That\x92s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank\nyou. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.'"
Rachel:,b' Yes!!'
Chandler:,"b' All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)'"
Ross:,"b' (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?'"
Chandler:,"b' Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like\nit was no big deal.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeesh, what\x92d you do about it?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I didn\x92t do anything. I didn\x92t want to be the guy who\nhas a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, maybe it\x92s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football\nplayers pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt) """
Rachel:,"b"" Y'know I don\x92t, I don\x92t understand guys, I mean I-I would\nnever congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin\x92 her boob."""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head\nin between \x91em."""
Joey:,b' Yeah. What are we getting?'
Ross:,"b"" All right so, Chandler, from now on, don\x92t give your boss a chance to\nget you. Y'know just ah, don\x92t turn your back to him."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you\ncould rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to\nsmack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that\nwould smell bad?"""
Chandler:,b' (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I\nset Ross up on a date?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, ah with who?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,\nand now that you two aren\x92t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if\nyou\x92re not cool with it...'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?'"
Phoebe:,"b' You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She\x92s yeah,\nlike, average height, medium build, bald...'"
Rachel:,b' Oh! (laughs) That\x92s fine.'
Phoebe:,"b' Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)'"
Rachel:,"b' (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft\npretzel from one of the kids from '"
Phoebe:,b' Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)'
Rachel:,b' This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You\x92re\nBonnie?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, I\x92m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I\nsaw you.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, that must be it.'"
Phoebe:,b' (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.'
Rachel:,b' (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, she was bald, she\x92s not now.'"
Rachel:,b' How could you not tell me that she has hair?'
Phoebe:,"b' I don\x92t know, I hardly ever say that about people.'"
Rachel:,"b' (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well I\x92m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.\nI mean, y'know, that girl has hair got """
Phoebe:,"b' Well, maybe it won\x92t work out. Maybe Ross won\x92t like her\npersonality.'"
Rachel:,"b' Why, does she have a bad personality?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no, Bonnie\x92s the best!'"
Chandler:,b' (to his co-workers) What is with him?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, that\x92s not true, he-he smacked you once.'"
Chandler:,b' No sir.'
Ross:,b' (walking up with this '
Ross:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents,\nplus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!'"
Ross:,"b' Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.'"
Ross:,b' All right! You go get him! Let\x92s go!'
Ross:,b' Hey! How long until Pete\x92s fight?'
Ross:,b' Hot dog?'
Phoebe:,"b' So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?'"
Ross:,"b' What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn\x92t expecting to like her at all,\nI mean I actually wasn\x92t expecting to like anyone right now, but she\x92s really\nterrific.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, that\x92s too bad!'"
Ross:,"b' No, I-I\x92m saying I liked her.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."""
Ross:,"b' Pheebs, I think she\x92s great. Okay? We\x92re going out again.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?'"
Chandler:,b' (joining them) Hey! Which one\x92s my turkey burger?'
Ross:,"b' Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.'"
Joey:,"b' (sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight\x92s starting!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, we\x92ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to\nslap you again today?'"
Chandler:,"b' Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it\x92s gonna be\nokay, because as of tomorrow I\x92m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as\nplanned, my butt will be smack free.'"
Joey:,b' (sticking his head out the window) Fight\x92s over!'
Chandler:,"b' Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I ah, I didn\x92t do them.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no I just ah, didn\x92t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a\ncouple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don\x92t deserve any praise,\nverbal or otherwise.'"
Chandler:,b' Doug!!'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express\nyourself.'
Chandler:,"b' No, no. It-it\x92s not about the swearing, it\x92s more about ah,\nthe way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, and don\x92t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It\x92s\njust that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it\x92s making all\nthe other guys jealous.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. (he starts to leave)'
Chandler:,"b' Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or\ninside his shower drain?'"
Rachel:,"b' (seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look,\nit\x92s Ross and that girl.'"
Phoebe:,b' No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It\x92s a line\nof ants! They\x92re working as a team!'
Rachel:,b' Phoebe! (goes back to the window)'
Phoebe:,"b' (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is\nbreaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let\x92s go.'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them.\nOkay that\x92s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that\x92s\nwhat that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no! That really is nothing, she is '"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now\nhe loves her, he\x92s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.'"
Phoebe:,b' You said it was okay!'
Rachel:,b' You said she was bald!!'
Phoebe:,b' What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!'
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, we can\x92t, we just can\x92t just let it happen! Okay, we\nhave to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her\nhead! You owe me one bald girl!!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don\x92t get it.\nAren\x92t you the one that decided that you didn\x92t want to be with Ross?'"
Rachel:,b' (quietly) Yes.'
Phoebe:,b' Well isn\x92t he your friend? Don\x92t you want him to be happy?'
Rachel:,b' Yes.'
Phoebe:,b' So?'
Rachel:,"b"" I just y'know, I didn\x92t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff.\nOoo-ooh! (sits down on the curb) """
Phoebe:,b' (sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, we killed them all.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh! '
Chandler:,"b' Thank you, sir.'"
Chandler:,"b' No. No, not at all, that\x92s-that\x92s ridiculous.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!'"
Chandler:,"b' Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I can\x92t watch this. (turns her eyes away)'"
Joey:,"b' Check it out, he\x92s winning! (to Monica) Pete\x92s winning!'"
Joey:,b' No-o-o!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, if that\x92s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn\x92t\nwant to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can\x92t.'"
