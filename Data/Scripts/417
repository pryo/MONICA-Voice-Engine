Joey:,b' (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?'
Chandler:,b' Treeger\x92s snaking the shower drain.'
Joey:,b' Maybe he found you flip-flop.'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'

Chandler:,b' Do we pay for this?'
Joey:,"b' No, we didn\x92t even pay our cable bill\x97maybe this is how they\npunish us.'"
Chandler:,b' Maybe we shouldn\x92t pay our phone bill\x97free phone sex.'
Joey:,b' Maybe we shouldn\x92t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he\njust said.)'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!'"
Chandler:,b' Like finding money with naked people on it!'
Joey:,b' (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)'
Rachel:,"b' All right, y\x92know what, come on, do we really have to watch this\nwhile we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)'"
Chandler:,b' We don\x92t know what could make this go away.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!'"
Chandler:,b' And no one touches the '
Joey:,"b' Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?'"
Chandler:,b' We still have porn.'

Rachel:,"b' Honey, what are you doing? That\x92s too heavy.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica\nright away.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, I\x92m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid\nmassage table. Y\x92know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She\ngoes over and stands in front of the TV.)'"
Chandler:,b' Or a job where you don\x92t have to carry a table.'
Phoebe:,b' You mean like a doctor?'
Joey:,b' Pheebs! You\x92re blocking the porn! Look out!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN\ntoday.'"

Ross:,b' (Thinks about it.) Nah.'
Ross:,"b' Well I, that\x92s the thing, I don\x92t know! I mean, whenever I\nbrought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) ""This is so fantastic! Why do\nwe have to talk about the future? Let\x92s just enjoy\x85""'"
Ross:,b' And why do you care so much?'
Ross:,b' You had fantasies about Emily?'
Ross:,b' Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that\nUkrainian kid?'
Ross:,b' Ahh.'
Ross:,"b' We said it was only going to be two weeks, y\x92know?'"
Ross:,b' What-what is love really?'

Phoebe:,b' Ooh! Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh well, okay, hey, y\x92know how when you\x92re umm, you\x92re\nwalking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh,\nthat\x92s nice?""'"

Phoebe:,"b' Oh God, I\x92m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were\ngoing to be all freaked.'"

Ross:,b' Emily! (Runs up.)'
Ross:,"b' I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.'"

Ross:,"b' (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,\nI\x92ve been thinking, I\x92m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I\nthink I love you.'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s no problem.'
Rachel:,b' What\x92s that song? It has been in my head all day long.'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s the theme from Good Will Humping.'
Rachel:,b' Y\x92know who doesn\x92t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend\nJoshua.'
Joey:,b' Yeah right.'
Rachel:,"b' No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was\ncorny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?'"
Rachel:,b' Yes!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, he likes porn.'"
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too\nskinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is\nhaving three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I\nwant to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, \x91cause you work for a big company.\nOkay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.'"
Chandler:,b' They don\x92t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get\nyou some free white out though.'
Ross:,b' I did.'
Ross:,b' Thank you.'
Ross:,"b' She said, ""Thank you."" I said, ""I love you."" And she\nsaid, ""Thank you.""'"
Chandler:,"b' Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!'"
Ross:,b' What do I do now?'
Joey:,b' You play hard to get.'
Ross:,b' She already lives in London.'
Joey:,b' Then you go to Tokyo.'
Chandler:,"b' All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,\nit\x92s over.'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (Pause) Good one.'
Ross:,"b' Okay! Okay! But if she doesn\x92t call, it is definitely over! No, wait.\nWait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y\x92know just to she what\x92s going on, and,\nand she says she\x92ll call me back, but then she doesn\x92t. '"
Joey:,"b' Way to be strong, man!'"
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn\nbreak. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, so, why don\x92t you just turn it off?'"
Chandler:,b' Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.'
Phoebe:,"b' (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you\x92re hear! Okay.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, what-what \x91cha got there?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh this, well I\x92m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a\nknife and an soda can.) Now, don\x92t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an\nordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you\x92re\nthinking\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Pregnant Woman Slays Four?'
Phoebe:,b' No!'
Phoebe:,b' No!'
Rachel:,"b' Honey, you\x92re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice\njust by selling knives.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second\npart of my plan.'"
Chandler:,b' What\x92s the second part of your plan?'
Phoebe:,b' My '
Ross:,b' (Answers the phone.) Hello?'
Ross:,"b' Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?'"
Ross:,"b' No, no, that-that, that\x92s all right. Umm, I\x92m just glad you\ncalled.'"
Ross:,b' Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?'
Ross:,"b' She doesn\x92t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.'"
Ross:,b' Well\x85'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m not proving anything. Okay, I\x92m done listening to you. If I\nhadn\x92t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never\nwould\x92ve put my fist through the wall!'"
Chandler:,b' You put your fist through the wall?'
Ross:,"b' No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. \x91Cause you already told her\nyou love her and she didn\x92t say it back, then she called you and told you that\nthere\x92s another guy, so yeah, go to London that\x92ll scare her!'"
Ross:,b' I made fun of his accent.'
Ross:,b' No.'
Ross:,b' Really?'

Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I\x92m\ngonna open up my own massage place and Frank\x92s gonna help me! And! We can work it\naround his schedule so he doesn\x92t have to quit school!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys\nused for catering and we realised\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m telling it! I\x92m telling it!'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need\nmassages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the\nmassages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know\nwhat I\x92ve got?'"
Chandler:,b' A place where no one will ever get out alive?'
Phoebe:,"b' No! Think about it, it\x92s a taxi that people take when they need to\nrelax, it\x92s\x85'"
Rachel:,b' (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!'
Phoebe:,b' The name was my favourite part!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, well I can up with it!'"
Phoebe:,b' '
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x85'"
Ross:,b' (on phone) Hey.'
Ross:,"b' No, because she hasn\x92t come home yet. And she hasn\x92t been home\nall night! She\x92s obviously staying with that other guy, and I\x92m the stupid moron\nwho spent the whole night outside her apartment!'"
Ross:,b' About four hours.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks\nthat\x92s better than Relaxi Cab.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, it\x92s not Relaxi Cab. It\x92s Relaxicab, like taxicab. '"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, that is better.'"
Chandler:,b' Are we in London?'
Joey:,"b' (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.'"
Ross:,"b' (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all\nthe way to New York.) I love you too! I\x92m, I\x92m gonna call you right now from the\nphone booth! (Realises) You can\x92t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)'"
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,b' Ohh! Thank you.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she\ndidn\x92t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.'"
Joey:,"b' Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,\ngives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!'"
Chandler:,"b' What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?""'"
Joey:,b' Noo! Nothing!'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know what, we have to turn off the porn.'"
Joey:,b' I think you\x92re right.'
Chandler:,"b' All right, ready?'"
Joey:,b' One.'
Chandler:,b' Two.'
Joey:,b' That\x92s kinda nice.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s kinda a relief.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
