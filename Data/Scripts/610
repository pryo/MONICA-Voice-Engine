Chandler:,"b' Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I\nremember when people used to use big lights.'"
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s a good story, Grandpa.'"
Ross:,b' Hey'
Ross:,b' Hey'
Ross:,"b' Wow, Monica\x92s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did\nsomeone get her drunk again or?'"
Ross:,"b' Wow, Monica\x92s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did\nsomeone get her drunk again or?'"
Phoebe:,b' That is nice and we\x92re done. TADA!'
Chandler:,"b' I dunno what it is, it just doesn\x92t quite feel like Christmas to\nme.'"
Chandler:,b' See now it feels like Christmas!'
Ross:,"b' \x85 and that\x92s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people\ntrace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into\ntheir huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life\x92s triumph over death.\nAnd that was like 4000 years ago.'"
Ross:,"b' \x85 and that\x92s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people\ntrace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into\ntheir huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life\x92s triumph over death.\nAnd that was like 4000 years ago.'"
Rachel:,"b' So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this\nstory.'"
Joey:,b' Hey you guys.'
Chandler:,b' Hey Joe what\x92s up?'
Joey:,"b' I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the\nplace. Y\x92know, everywhere I look she\x92s like\x85 (He imitates her stretching)'"
Chandler:,b' I can see why that\x92s hard to resist.'
Joey:,b' I like her so much!'
Joey:,b' I know. And she\x92s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush\nher hair.'
Chandler:,"b' You are aware that she\x92s not a monkey, right?'"
Ross:,"b' I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,\nbut now she\x92s like OLD NEWS!'"
Ross:,"b' I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,\nbut now she\x92s like OLD NEWS!'"
Ross:,b' Hi Janine!'
Ross:,b' Hi Janine!'
Chandler:,"b' Ah, you\x92re still just a little fat girl inside aren\x92t you?\n(He kisses her on the cheek)'"
Ross:,b' You\x92re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!'
Ross:,b' You\x92re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!'
Joey:,b' Totally! I would love to spend New Year\x92s with you.'
Ross:,"b' Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times\nSquare is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a\nlot of people know that.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times\nSquare is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a\nlot of people know that.'"
Ross:,b' Are you serious?'
Ross:,b' Are you serious?'
Chandler:,"b' What, what are you laughing at?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I used to date him, but you\x92re still going out with her!'"
Ross:,b' Bye Janine!'
Ross:,b' Bye Janine!'
Joey:,b' Did she just ask me out on a date?'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t think so.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I\x92m sorry,\nbut I don\x92t think that was a romantic thing.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We\x92re going to a New\nYear\x92s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back,\ngreat! Y\x92know? But if she says \x91Dude, what the hell are you doing?\x92 I can\nsay \x91It wasn\x92t me, it was New Years!\x92'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, that\x92s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High\nSchool, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.'"
Ross:,b' It was a dry day.'
Ross:,b' It was a dry day.'
Ross:,b' Oh my God!'
Ross:,b' Oh my God!'
Chandler:,b' (To Rachel) Oh '
Joey:,"b' OK, listen I\x92ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little\nadvice, alright? It\x92s a show, but we\x92re just dancing, OK? It\x92s no big deal.\nThe important thing to remember \x96 stay cool.'"
Ross:,b' Got it!'
Ross:,b' Got it!'
Ross:,b' Oh my God it\x92s just like I dreamed it!'
Ross:,b' Oh my God it\x92s just like I dreamed it!'
Ross:,b' Oh my God it\x92s just like I dreamed it!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?'"
Joey:,b' Ross! So when is it gonna air?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.'"
Chandler:,"b' I can save you time ladies, I\x92m right here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, Chandler why don\x92t you take a walk? This doesn\x92t concern\nyou.'"
Rachel:,b' We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.'
Chandler:,b' What? That\x92s terrible!'
Phoebe:,"b' No-no, we do it every year!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh well, that makes it not terrible.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, yeah, we never find them! She\x92s always best at us that wily\nminx.'"
Rachel:,"b' Don\x92t worry, we\x92re just gonna search here for an hour, them\nwe\x92re gonna go over to Joey\x92s and search, OK?'"
Chandler:,"b' No not okay, you can\x92t look for Monica\x92s presents!'"
Phoebe:,b' But we have to!'
Chandler:,"b' No, you don\x92t have to, and you can\x92t because I live here\ntoo.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well then, you should look with us.'"
Chandler:,b' Why?'
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, aren\x92t you worried about what to get Monica for\nChristmas?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I have a great idea for a present for her.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, that\x92s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!'"
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, that\x92s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great\npresent, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you\x92ve just gotten\nher one great present? I mean that\x92s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do\nthat to her Chandler? Why? Why?'"
Chandler:,"b' If I help, we can find \x91em faster!'"
Rachel:,b' That\x92s right!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh ooh, we have a live one!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it\x92s a '"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, who\x92s it for?'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-oh. She may be onto us.'
Rachel:,b' We are so gonna find them this year.'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and\nlook, you don\x92t, you don\x92t do that every year do you?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' You don\x92t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my\ngym bag or anything?'"
Chandler:,"b' Because that\x92s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that\nI\x92ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird\nclicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)'"
Ross:,b' Right. No biggie. Stay loose.'
Ross:,b' Right. No biggie. Stay loose.'
Ross:,b' Why do they keep doing that?'
Ross:,b' Why do they keep doing that?'
Ross:,b' Right.'
Ross:,b' Right.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, what\x92d you guys do to get up on there?'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, what\x92d you guys do to get up on there?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,b' Really?'
Joey:,b' What do you mean?'
Joey:,b' Uh-huh.'
Joey:,b' No-no-no-no-no we came together!'
Joey:,"b' No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and\nI think I have a shot.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"""
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some\ncoats.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!"""
Chandler:,"b' Those are my gifts, I got them for you.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!"""
Rachel:,"b' Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Those are book ends! That's a great gift!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz. """
Rachel:,b' Ha!'
Chandler:,"b' Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of\nyou that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!"""
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts\ndancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a\nplatform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place\ndance) Looking good Gellers!'"
Ross:,b' We know!'
Ross:,b' We know!'
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Monica! (Pause) Would it?'
Ross:,b' Monica! (Pause) Would it?'
Joey:,"b' Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that\nyou\x92re dancing with.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this\nplan to kiss her at the new years countdown \x96 I\x92m trying to win her over, so I\nwas wondering if..'"
Joey:,"b' Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she\x92s real, uh,\nmellow!'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Alright, alright, hey y\x92know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his\nhands) if you\x92re right, you\x92re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws\nwater on the guy\x92s pants)'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, now you\x92re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful\non him and runs out)'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, I know what\x92ll get us up on a platform!'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, I know what\x92ll get us up on a platform!'"

Ross:,"b' Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he\x92ll wanna build\nus our own platform!'"
Ross:,"b' We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!\nLook, it\x92s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?'"
Ross:,"b' We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!\nLook, it\x92s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?'"
Ross:,"b' So, do we really have to ask who\x92s going up on the platform\nnext?'"
Ross:,"b' So, do we really have to ask who\x92s going up on the platform\nnext?'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, take a look at the guy\x92s pants! I mean, I know you told us to\nshow excitement, but don\x92t you think he went a little overboard?'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, take a hike wetpants!'"
Ross:,b' Can you believe this? We\x92re gonna be on the platform for the\nMillennium moment!'
Ross:,b' Can you believe this? We\x92re gonna be on the platform for the\nMillennium moment!'

Phoebe:,b' Hey! Look who I found!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, hey guys!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought\nmaybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Or we could just follow your clever jokes \x96 any ideas? No!\nDidn\x92t think so! Okay, c\x92mon guys, show us where the presents are!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder\nwhat I could get Monica that\x92s as good as garbage?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hmm, how about my azzz?'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, this is hollow.'"
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' This bench, it\x92s hollow! I can\x92t believe I never knew that!\n(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!'"

Rachel:,"b' Whatever Linus, I\x92m opening mine.'"
Chandler:,"b' Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don\x92t know about you guys,\nbut I wanna see the look on Monica\x92s face when I give her my present, and I\x92m\nsure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just,\ncan we put them back?'"
Phoebe:,b' Will you get us better gifts?'
Chandler:,b' Fine!'

Rachel:,"b' Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from\neighth grade?'"
Rachel:,b' \x91Cos I was gonna say there\x92s no way you could\x92ve done the\nend the way you guys did it back then!'
