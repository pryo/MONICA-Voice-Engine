Chandler:,b' Skull?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, yeah, it's my mom's."""
Rachel:,b' (freaking out) Oh my god!!'
Phoebe:,"b"" No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she\nused to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people\nstill die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of\nlicorice, and takes a bite.)"""
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Ross:,"b' (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for\nthe holidays this year.'"

Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get\nready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out."""

Chandler:,b' Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, why not?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be\nliving with him."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?"""
Chandler:,"b' No reason, except\x85she\x85told\x85me.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Really? So she said, she didn\x92t wanna live with me anymore?'"
Chandler:,"b"" No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica\nnow."""
Phoebe:,"b"" You're sure? You're absolutely sure?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Probably? Yeah, I don\'t like that word. (Chandler and Monica look\nsurprised) Kind of what \x91probably\x92 really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh,\n""Your mom probably won\'t kill herself,"" y\x92know? I\'m sorry, but I\'m not\nhanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""\nY\x92know?

Chandler:,b' Is this because of the burrito thing?'
Chandler:,b' Give him money? It was a joke!'
Chandler:,"b"" Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."""
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)\nListen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd\nappreciate it. (Shakes his hand)"""
Chandler:,b' Okay. (Walks back to Monica)'
Chandler:,b' Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the\nmoney in it)'
Ross:,"b"" Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do\nya?"""

Ross:,"b"" (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest."""
Ross:,"b' Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating\nHanukkah?'"
Ross:,"b"" No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben."""
Ross:,"b"" No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is\nnot mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!"""
Ross:,"b"" (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!"""
Chandler:,b' How do you know so much about this?'
Chandler:,"b"" Richard used to do it, didn't he?"""
Chandler:,b' Mustached bastard\x85'
Chandler:,"b"" (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me..."""
Chandler:,"b"" (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his\nmoney, but he isn't there anymore)"""

Joey:,b' Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.'
Chandler:,b' Hey Pheebs!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! (she sits down next to him)'
Chandler:,"b' If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire\nbuilding, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a\nphial of small pox to release in the hallway?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react\nto drums.'"
Phoebe:,b' Maybe on some level.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, y\x92know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the\nair.'"
Joey:,"b"" What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?"""
Phoebe:,"b' (entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you\nanother present. (She puts it on the counter)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what\nis it?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" It's a\x85tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool\njumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,\ngross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"""
Rachel:,"b"" What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I\nhad a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my\ncat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?"""
Joey:,"b"" Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into\nhis room)"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."""

Phoebe:,b' Our apartment is ready.'
Rachel:,b' And that makes you angry because\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Because you would rather live here with Joey.'
Rachel:,b' Where did you get that?'
Phoebe:,b' Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And\napparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.'
Rachel:,b' Phoebe?'
Phoebe:,b' Hm?'
Rachel:,"b' Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the\napartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you\nknow how fish freaked me out!'"
Phoebe:,b' (nods along) Fish!'
Rachel:,"b"" It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live\ntogether, we're roommates; that's the deal."""

Rachel:,"b' Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the\nsticks)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.'"
Rachel:,b' (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and\nputs the sticks into it) Done!'

Ross:,b' (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.'
Ross:,"b"" That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.\nAnd Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.

Ross:,"b"" You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"""
Ross:,"b' (gasps) You are? Me, too!'"
Ross:,"b' (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if\nthe Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...'

Ross:,"b"" I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to\ngive Ben some presents. Remember?"""
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b"" You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money\nfalls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands\nweren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!"""
Ross:,b' (to Chandler) What are you doing?'
Chandler:,"b' You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa\ncostume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!'"
Ross:,"b' Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.'"
Chandler:,b' Why?'
Ross:,"b"" Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and\nyou're-you\x92re wrecking it."""
Chandler:,"b"" But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly."""
Ross:,"b"" I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."""
Chandler:,"b"" Fine, I'll give the suit back."""
Chandler:,b' Santa? Really?'
Chandler:,b' Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?'
Chandler:,"b"" Then it's okay! (They kiss.)"""
Ross:,"b' Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!'"
Chandler:,"b' Because, if Santa and the Holiday\x85Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are\never in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!'"
Ross:,"b' Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,\nwill you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"""
