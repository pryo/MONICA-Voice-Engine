Ross:,b' (to Ben) Everything okay in there?'
Rachel:,"b' Awww, just like his daddy.'"
Ross:,b' Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean\x92s office just called\nand said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?'
Rachel:,b' What-what about Monica?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, she isn\x92t home.'"

Chandler:,b' You mean the spitter?'
Chandler:,b' Easy for you to say; you\x92ll be wearing a veil.'
Chandler:,b' You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?'
Chandler:,"b' Sorry, I just don\x92t like the idea of when I say ""I\ndo,"" he\x92s thinking, ""Yeah, I\x92d do her too!""'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah!'
Phoebe:,b' (returning with Joey) With what?'
Phoebe:,b' Oo! You should have one of us do it!'
Phoebe:,b' No! No! It\x92s-it\x92s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on\nthe Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!'
Phoebe:,b' Yes! A friend of mine did it and it\x92s totally legal!'
Joey:,b' I call it!!'
Phoebe:,b' What?! No! It was my idea!'
Chandler:,b' Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.'
Joey:,b' Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!'
Chandler:,"b' We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say\nlegitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ben y\x92know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang\nout all the time. \x91Cause I was, I was your daddy\x92s girlfriend.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, I\x92m not.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey! We were '
Rachel:,"b' (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and\nsisters, huh? That must be nice. You don\x92t have to share stuff.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you\x92re one of '"
Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,\nwe\x92d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so\nthey\x92d put salt on their cereal.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah? You like that one?'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I\x92ve got a ton of these!\nUmm, oh here\x97Do you want a good one? Here\x92s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a\nquarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say\nto person, I bet you can\x92t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without\nit leaving your face. And then when they do it, they\x92re left with a big black pencil\nline right down the center of their face.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I-I-I-I\x92m funny Ben, but I\x92m not stupid. Okay?'"
Joey:,"b' So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were\nstill together.'"
Joey:,b' Well then let me do it!'
Chandler:,b' Joe\x85'
Joey:,"b' No-no-no! Look, I\x92ve been thinking about it. I\x92m an actor right?\nSo I won\x92t get nervous talking in front of people.'"
Joey:,"b' No-no-no-no look no! I won\x92t spit, and I won\x92t stare at\nMonica\x92s breasts! Y\x92know? Everyone knows I\x92m an ass man!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah and the most important thing is that it won\x92t be some like,\nstranger up there who barely knows you. It\x92ll be me! And I swear I\x92ll do a\nreally good job. Plus, y\x92know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to\nme.'"
Chandler:,"b' (To Monica) Y\x92know, we haven\x92t found anybody else.'"
Joey:,b' So I can do it?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah you can do it.'
Joey:,"b' All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my\nspeech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God, you\x92ve '"
Phoebe:,b' What is it?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no, I don\x92t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply\npressure to these points right here. (She\x92s pinching the bit of skin between her\nright thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you\nstill have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Joey:,"b' Oh! My head! Oh! (He\x92s sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his\nfeet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!'"
Rachel:,b' Coming. '
Ross:,b' I have a bone to pick with you.'
Rachel:,b' Uh-oh.'
Ross:,b' Yes! Ben learned a little trick.'
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah? Did he pull the old\x85 (She is waving her hand up and down\nher face. She\x92s thinking about the pencil mark.)'
Ross:,b' That\x92s right! That\x92s right! '
Rachel:,b' Oh that.'
Ross:,b' Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They\x92re mean and\nthey\x92re stupid and-and I don\x92t want my son learning them!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, come on! '"
Ross:,"b' I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught\nhim right?'"
Rachel:,b' (looking at his mark) Yes.'
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills\ncalled?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a\nstory! (She pulls out the instructions and side effects paper.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Say what?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,\nfacial swelling, nausea, headache\x97Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage!\nNow okay, I don\x92t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death\ncapsules! Oh I\x92m sorry, extra strength death capsules!'"
Phoebe:,b' Why?'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing\nthe proof of his ordination.)'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!'"
Chandler:,b' Our minister\x85'
Phoebe:,b' I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, then I must be disoriented.'"
Joey:,"b' Anyway, I started working on what I\x92m going to say for the ceremony,\ndo you wanna hear it?'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so\x85 (Starts to read the\npiece of paper he brought.) ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to\ncelebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."" (Monica and Chandler like\nit so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) ""It is a love based on giving and receiving.\nAs well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and\nreceived. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."" (Phoebe nods\nher approval.) ""We too can share and love and have and receive.""'"
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your\nbuilding and I thought to myself, ""What\x92s up with Carol and sweet, little\nBen?""'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92d love that. I would loooove\x85 (Carol goes to make the coffee\nand she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...'"
Rachel:,"b' I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the\ncoffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I\x92ve come here to talk to you\nokay?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes oh\x97(To Ben)\x97Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)\nNo, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that\nstuff I taught you yesterday?'"
Rachel:,b' Don\x92t do that.'
Rachel:,"b' Seriously, your dad doesn\x92t like pranks.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh damnit!'
Rachel:,b' No! Don\x92t say that! Don\x92t say that!'
Rachel:,b' No don\x92t! Go back to repeating!'
Rachel:,b' Oh crap!'
Phoebe:,b' I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!\n(Holds up the warning label.)'"
Joey:,"b' Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah. O-okay.'
Joey:,"b' (reading) ""When I think of the love that these two givers and\nreceivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and\ngiving and\x85"" And then I can\x92t think of a good word for right here. (He\npoints to the stop on the paper where he left off.)'"
Joey:,b' Yes!'
Chandler:,"b' See Joe, not that that\x92s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things\nabout having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!\nY\x92know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!'"
Joey:,"b' Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so\nhard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, not us\x85 (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)'"
Joey:,"b' I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole\nanything?'"
Phoebe:,b' Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the\neyes?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!'
Chandler:,"b' See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y\x92know, romantic\nstories. Nice stories.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I\x92ll talk about London! Y\x92know\nwhen you two hooked up! Only, only I won\x92t say hooked up. I\x92ll say, ""Began\ntheir beautiful journey\x85""'"
Joey:,"b' ""\x85by doin\x92 it.""'"
Chandler:,b' Joe?'
Joey:,"b' Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet\nacross the room? And then the next thing y\x92know you\x92re in the bathtub together\nand she\x92s feeding you strawberries?'"
Chandler:,b' Isn\x92t that what happened with you and the bridesmaid?'
Joey:,b' Yeah!! I call that London style.'
Joey:,b' Oh.'
Joey:,b' Yeah baby!'
Chandler:,b' And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and\nsaid goodnight.'
Joey:,b' Oh.'
Chandler:,b' But then later that night\x85'
Joey:,b' Yeah baby!'
Chandler:,b' (answering the door) Hey!'
Chandler:,"b"" Well I was\x85 I wasn't exactly expecting company after\x85(He looks\nat his watch.) 9:15."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the\nbridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you\x92re not still upset about\nwhat that guy told ya are ya?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, look it\x92s been a really emotional time y\x92know, and\nyou\x92ve had a lot to drink. And you\x92ve just got to let that '"
Chandler:,b' You kidding? You\x92re the most beautiful woman in most rooms\x85\n(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What\x92s going\non? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?'
Chandler:,b' But we don\x92t do that.'
Chandler:,b' How drunk are you?'
Chandler:,b' (thinks) That\x92s the perfect amount!'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' I know.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna\nget under the covers?'"
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Chandler:,b' It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.'
Chandler:,b' Yep!'
Chandler:,b' Count of three?'
Chandler:,b' Two!'
Chandler:,b' Well I think it\x92s safe to say that our friendship is effectively\nruined.'
Chandler:,b' Eh!'
Chandler:,b' Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers\nas Joey enters. Remember?)'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e\x85 (Notices that the TV is\nturned off.)'
Joey:,"b' Oh, dude I\x92m so sorry!'"
Chandler:,b' No! No! No!'
Joey:,"b' Hey no-no-no-no! It\x92s cool! It\x92s cool! I-I\x92ll only be a\nsecond, I\x92m still with my bridesmaid, I just\x97Where are those condoms you\nbrought?'"
Chandler:,b' They\x92re in my bag over there. (Points.)'
Joey:,b' Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler\x92s bag by getting as far away from\nChandler\x92s bed as possible.)'
Chandler:,"b' Uh, could you leave me one?'"
Joey:,b' (pause) For just you?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Hey listen, why don\x92t you come downstairs with me? There\x92s some\nreally nice girls down there.'"
Chandler:,b' No I-I-I\x92m fine.'
Joey:,"b' All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s what that was?! \x91Cause that other thing? I thought you\nwere on to something, but it did nothing for me.'"
Joey:,b' Oh\x85 (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn\x92t left you that last\none? You two might\x92ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent\nthat hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It\x92s like it was in the stars!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you\noriginally wanted to hook up with that night.'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' (To Joey) What?!'
Chandler:,b' Who did you originally want to hook up with?'
Joey:,b' Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever\nin-intend on telling me about this?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, it\x92s not important? It\x92s not important?! If it\nwasn\x92t for a bridesmaid you\x92d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!'"
Joey:,b' And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv\x97(Shuts\nup on Monica\x92s glare.)'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and\nI\x92m runner up.'
Joey:,"b' Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I\x92m a man of the cloth, but\nI still have feelings!'"
Chandler:,b' (To Joey) Look there is no way you\x92re doing this wedding now.\nOkay?'
Joey:,"b' What?! That\x92s not fair! It\x92s not my fault! I was off with my\nbridesmaid! And who\x92s to say I would\x92ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I\nmean I would\x92ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of\nthis, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, it\x92s just weird! Okay? I don\x92t want to be standing\ntheir saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need\x85I\ndon\x92t know what I need. I need a walk.'"
Chandler:,b' It is to me. You wanted to sleep with '
Joey:,b' This is crazy.'
Phoebe:,b' I know! '
Rachel:,b' So now what have we agreed?'
Rachel:,b' And-and what else?'
Rachel:,b' Very good.'
Ross:,b' Rachel! What are you doing here?'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m just visiting my good friend Carol.'
Ross:,b' Your good friend?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' What\x92s her last name?'
Rachel:,b' Carol\x85Lesbian?'
Ross:,"b' Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?'"
Rachel:,b' What line?'
Ross:,b' Wh-wh-what line? The '
Rachel:,"b' All right, I\x92m sorry. I\x92m sorry I didn\x92t tell you but you\nwere so mad already!'"
Ross:,b' Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it\x92s\nnot funny!'
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,b' Practical jokes.'
Ross:,b' You have a line down your face.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, maybe they are not funny to you\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Or Carol! But they\x92re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!'
Ross:,"b' Uh, y\x92know what? I\x92ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid\nwho has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal\x92s office\nwearing nothing but a catcher\x92s mitt!'"
Rachel:,b' That was '
Ross:,"b' I will be! Listen, I don\x92t want you teaching my son that stuff\nanymore. Okay?'"
Rachel:,"b' Fine. Fine, but I\x92ll have you know that once I taught him that\nstuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I\x92ll go\nback to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that\x92s what you want!'"
Ross:,"b' No that\x92s not what I want. Uh, I\x92m glad you guys were bonding\nbut I\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Look he doesn\x92t have any brothers or sisters, somebody\x92s gonna\nhave to teach him this stuff! And I haven\x92t taught him anything that a normal\n6-year-old doesn\x92t know anyway!'"
Rachel:,b' I gotta go! (Runs out.)'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but\nit would probably rather sleep with you!'
Joey:,"b' Chandler, come on nothing even happened!'"
Chandler:,"b' Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding\x85'"
Joey:,"b' No-hey-no! If you don\x92t want me to do it, I accept that. I don\x92t\ncare about that. I just\x85I don\x92t want you to be upset.'"
Chandler:,b' How can I not be upset? Okay? I '
Joey:,"b' Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the\nrest of her life! You\x92re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there!\nAlthough you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, \x91cause you guys\nare perfect for each other. Y\x92know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it\njust\x85it-it fits. Y\x92know? And you just know it\x92s gonna last forever.'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s what you should say.'
Joey:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' When you\x92re marrying us; that\x92s what you should say.'
Joey:,b' Really? I can do it?'
Chandler:,b' I\x92d love it if you would do it.'
Joey:,b' Hey! (They hug.)'
Chandler:,b' But those are the words! Those '
Joey:,"b' Well I don\x92t know if I remember exactly but, it\x92s-it\x92s pretty\nmuch about having and giving and sharing and receiving.'"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Hey I\x92m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you\ncan look after Ben for a little bit? I-I\x92ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he\nasked for his uh, \x91Fun Aunt\x92 Rachel, so\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don\x92t we Ben?\n(He nods yes.)'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x92ll see you later pal.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads \x91Poop.\x92)\nWh\x97Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can\x92t do it.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' I can\x92t let him go out that way, he\x92s got a meeting. (To Ross)\nYou\x92ve got something here on your back.'"
Ross:,b' What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That\x92s great.\nThat is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just\nfinish talking about Ben?!'
Rachel:,b' Oh I\x85'
Ross:,"b' All right, that\x92s it! (He runs over to Ben, who runs past him and\nout the door.) Come\x97you\x97no! You are in big trouble young man!'"
Rachel:,b' No! Wait! Come on!'
Ross:,"b' Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am '"
Rachel:,b' No you guys\x85 (She walks out into the hallway.)'
Ross:,b' I-I-am\x97(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the\nstairs landing just in front of Rachel.)'
Rachel:,b' EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to\nhim and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' So are guys doing okay?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little\nbit and some things in life are more important.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what\nwould happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.'"
Joey:,"b' Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!'"
Joey:,b' Here you go.'
Phoebe:,b' (still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks\nher watch) That\x92s it! I\x92m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!'
Joey:,b' Good for you!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s like a huge weight has been lifted! \x91Cause look, (reads\nthe side effects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I\x92m just so happy! Because no\nshortness of breath, no temporary euphoria\x97Oh.'"
