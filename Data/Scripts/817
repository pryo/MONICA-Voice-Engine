Rachel:,b' Joey? Are you in there?'
Joey:,b' (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That\x92s Rachel!'
Joey:,"b' No-no, I can\x92t! I can\x92t! Not after the other night, it\x92s\njust it\x92s\x85too weird, okay? Don\x92t tell her I\x92m here! (Turns to run to\nthe bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don\x92t eat that! (Runs\nto the bathroom as Rachel enters.)'"
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Is Joey here?'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, at least you make each other laugh.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I haven\x92t seen him since that night that he told me how he\ny\x92know\x85 I don\x92t know, I think he\x92s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on\nthe floor?'"
Rachel:,"b' Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of\nsituation?'"
Chandler:,b' What?! No! No!'
Rachel:,"b' All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him\nuh\x85tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)\nDude, I don\x92t know. That\x92s a pretty small hole.'"
Joey:,b' I can\x92t! Y\x92know? You guys don\x92t know what it\x92s like to\nput yourself out there like that and just get shot down.'
Chandler:,"b' (incredulous) I don\x92t know what that\x92s like?! Up until I was\n25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!""'"
Joey:,"b' All right so, so what do I do?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)\nWhoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your\x85'
Chandler:,b' (interrupting him) We didn\x92t play it!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so when you\x92re done with your tea I\x92ll look at your\nleaves and tell you your fortune.'"
Chandler:,b' I didn\x92t know you read tea leaves.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, I\x92ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was\nso accurate. Y\x92know, and-and y\x92know, one of the great joys of life is\nit\x92s-it\x92s wondrous unpredictability. Y\x92know? And also tea tends to give me\nthe trots.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)\nWhich can mean either a promotion or a violent death.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who\x92s next?'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, I\x92m done. Do mine.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.'"
Rachel:,b' Ah.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you\x92re having a baby\nor you\x92re gonna make a scientific discovery!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.'"
Chandler:,b' What does yours say Pheebs?'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm\x85 Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I\x92m\ngonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he\x92s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably\nnot the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)'"
Ross:,"b' (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It\x92s a button down, like a,\nlike a faded salmon?'"
Ross:,b' Faded salmon color.'
Ross:,b' Great! Great. Then I must\x92ve left it at Mona\x92s. I knew it!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I\x92m sure you get another one at '"
Ross:,b' That\x92s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!'
Rachel:,b' Well just ask Mona to give it back!'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It\x92s just that we\ndidn\x92t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I\x92d be ignoring\nthe one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks\naway.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a\nsecond you guys\x85for the last couple weeks I\x92ve been that guy everywhere I go. We\ntake the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he\x92s the\ntea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!\n(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of '"
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,"b' So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it\x92s\nnot even like we know how to be with each other anymore.'"
Chandler:,"b' I know it\x92s tough now, but things will get better.'"
Rachel:,"b' How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to\nthe point where we can\x92t even be in the same room with each other?!'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic\ncomment? Some cheese?'"
Chandler:,b' Let\x92s just say if I can\x92t find the right CD case I just put\nit in the nearest one.'
Chandler:,b' In the James Taylor case.'
Chandler:,"b' Honey, I\x92m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in\nthe right case.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, if we\x92re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of\norder. Y\x92know alphabetically or by genre?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!'
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah. That makes sense.'
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, I can do that.'"
Chandler:,b' They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica\x92s look)\nin exchange for money.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' So you uh, have a\x85big work problem?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah it\x92s umm\x85 Yeah it\x92s uh\x85 It-it\x92s\ny\x92know\x97It\x92s nothing.'
Joey:,"b' Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I\x92m gonna take off.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah\x97No wait! Joey no wait it is. It\x92s something.\nIt\x92s-it\x92s umm\x85it\x92s my boss.'
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, and umm my baby.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,b' My boss wants to buy my baby!'
Joey:,b' What?! Oh my-oh my God!'
Rachel:,"b' I know I told you, it\x92s a really big problem.'"
Joey:,b' What he wants to buy your baby?!'
Rachel:,b' Can you believe that?!'
Joey:,b' That\x92s crazy!'
Rachel:,b' That\x92s what I told him!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, how did this even happen?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well I\x92ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his\nwife\x97They-they can\x92t have children. So umm, and that\x97we were at the\nChristmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your\nbaby.""'"
Joey:,b' Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured\nit was something about maternity leave.'
Rachel:,b' Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would\x92ve been a much simpler\nproblem.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh hello.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I\x92m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have\nbeen seeing a lot of each other lately. '"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and\nthe exchange information.)'"
Ross:,"b' Mona? (There\x92s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where\nher extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He\nlooks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his\nbrain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to\nsqueal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the\nkey to open the door and enter Mona\x92s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,\nwhere would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies\nof the '"
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!'
Rachel:,b' Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.'
Chandler:,b' What problem did you tell him you had?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh that\x92s not important. The point is, I really\x97I think\neverything\x92s gonna be okay.'"
Joey:,b' Do you think you can just '
Phoebe:,b' Isn\x92t it funny how we kept running into each other? It\x92s as if\nsomeone really wants us to be together.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, witty banter. Well done.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh okay, well I\x92m a masseuse, and I used to work at this\nplace\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' I-I-I like, I like parties.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah I guess, a little.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone\nwildly I guess, for umm\x97Well since I was fourteen.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh stop it.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Umm look, you\x92re coming on a little strong. But I\x92m\ngoing to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to\nbe together. So, why don\x92t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about\nyourself.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!'
Phoebe:,b' Wow! You do?'
Phoebe:,b' All right. (Gets up and walks out.)'
Chandler:,b' (singing) '
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about\nthat thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.'"
Joey:,"b' Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy\x92s not going to be\nbothering you about that baby thing anymore.'"
Rachel:,b' (worried) What?'
Joey:,b' Let\x92s just say I took care of it.'
Rachel:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa, let\x92s say more!'"
Joey:,"b' Don\x92t worry! Don\x92t worry. I just told him, very nicely,\n""You don\x92t go buying people\x92s babies, so back off!!""'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b' No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn\x92t want to buy my baby! I made that\nup!'"
Joey:,b' What?! Why?!'
Rachel:,b' So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn\x92t be\nawkward!'
Joey:,b' And you couldn\x92t think of anything else?!'
Rachel:,b' (To Joey) I can\x92t believe that you yelled at my boss!\nI\x92m-I\x92m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!'
Chandler:,b' You can always sell your baby.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh Joey, I can\x92t believe you brought my boss into this! I\x92m\ngonna get fired!'"
Joey:,b' You lied to me!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)'"
Ross:,b' Hello!!'
Ross:,b' Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.'
Rachel:,b' Morning. You wanted to see me?'
Rachel:,b' Okay look Mr. Zelner\x85'
Rachel:,b' Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh God.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh there it is.'
Phoebe:,"b' I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I\nhave to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult\nbookstore, a new grocery store\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy\nand that\x92s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I\x92m going to kick\nsome ass.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, we both can. And we both will.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, you didn\x92t have to come in with me.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah well, I\x92m sorry about that too, but what are you going to\ndo?'"
Phoebe:,b' A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now\nyou\x92re talking.'
Phoebe:,b' I-I-I\x92d love to. Let me just tell my friend.'
Phoebe:,b' (looking around) She must\x92ve left.'
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,b' So? What-what-what happened?'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s all gonna be okay. They\x92re just so happy that I\x92m\nnot suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I\nunderstand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other\nchild I should bear.'
Chandler:,"b' Wow, '"
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, can you give us a minute?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh I\x92m sorry, you\x92re kicking me out of my own living room?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' I\x92ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, I\x92m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to\nmake things\x85'"
Joey:,b' I know. I know.'
Rachel:,"b' It kinda worked. I mean y\x92know, I don\x92t know about you buy I\nhaven\x92t thought about our thing since all this.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey you\x92re right. Yeah, it\x92s kinda been like us again a little\nbit.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah I know! I miss that.'
Joey:,b' Me too. I mean I\x85haven\x92t thought at all about how I put myself\nout there and said all that stuff and how you didn\x92t feel the same way about me\nand-and how it was really awkward.'
Rachel:,b' My gynecologist tried to kill me.'
Ross:,"b' (on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There\x92s a knock on the\ndoor as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in.\n(She does so.) I\x92m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I\x92m really sorry. It\x92s\njust that I\x85 (He picks up the pink shirt.)'"
Ross:,b' You do?'
Ross:,b' (faking starting to cry) Oh God you\x92re right.'
Ross:,b' (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)'
