Ross:,"b"" Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But"""
Chandler:,"b"" I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?"""
Ross:,"b' Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did'"
Rachel:,"b"" I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls \n  at the party, GOD!"""
Ross:,b' Why do you care so much?'
Rachel:,"b"" (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... \n  and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying \n  is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each \n  other's tonsils..."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids \n  and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, \n  those nerds will get"""
Rachel:,"b"" All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with \n  it..."""
Ross:,"b' Oh, God. I forgot how'"
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b"" I'm gonna get some more coffee."""
Ross:,b' Ok. (they both go)'
Chandler:,"b' (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! She is cool, and she\'s so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious \n  (which, being Joey, he mispronounces ""amonious""). (pause) That\'s not \n  how she used it...?'"
Ross:,"b"" Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, \n  you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like \n  someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."""
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I know the type.'"
Joey:,"b"" Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. \n  No? Am I getting close?"""
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of \n  slippers)'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?'"
Phoebe:,b' I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania \n  Twain.'
Rachel:,"b' (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things \n  that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."""
Rachel:,"b' Well, I would like to have the option!!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift \n  certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!"""
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Phoebe:,"b' No, you can\'t go there! You know how I feel about these ""big \n  massage places""! They\'re putting people like me out of business!'"
Rachel:,"b"" Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing \n  away a hundred bucks!"""
Phoebe:,"b' Ok, this is not about the'"
Rachel:,"b"" I don't care about any of that!!"""
Phoebe:,"b' Well, do you care about friendship?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Phoebe:,"b"" I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use \n  this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!"""
Phoebe:,b' Promise?'
Rachel:,b' I promise.'
Phoebe:,b' Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)'
Rachel:,b' But I am going hunting!!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yeah?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the \n  table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)'"
Chandler:,b' We really need to take those tests?'
Chandler:,"b"" But I don't wanna do it in a cup!"""
Chandler:,"b"" It's weird! In a doctor's office?"""
Chandler:,"b"" (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) \n  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than \n  on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!'"
Joey:,b' (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost \n  more than milk!'
Joey:,b' Heeey!'
Joey:,"b' Come on in, how are ya?'"
Joey:,b' Can I offer you a drink?'
Joey:,"b' Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to \n  open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?'"
Joey:,b' (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!'
Joey:,"b' I know, yeah!'"
Joey:,"b' Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna \n  see the Yankees.'"
Joey:,"b' Which one, they all suck!'"
Joey:,"b"" (looking puzzled) I don't think so."""
Rachel:,b' (to the receptionist) Hi there!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and \n  here is my gift certificate.'"
Rachel:,b' And... taped back together.'
Rachel:,b' Ok'
Rachel:,"b"" (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors."""
Rachel:,b' Alright-y then.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She \n  sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine \n  and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are."""
Phoebe:,"b"" 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that \n  this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!"""
Phoebe:,"b' (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?'"
Joey:,b' Ross!'
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' I need to talk to you about Charlie.'
Ross:,"b' (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem."""
Ross:,"b' Look, if you don\'t know what the word ""acrimonious"" \n  means, just don\'t use it!'"
Joey:,"b"" No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her \n  body is soo..."""
Ross:,b' Get to the problem!'
Joey:,"b"" Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've \n  ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!"""
Ross:,b' (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?'
Joey:,"b' (checking) EH, what do you know!'"
Ross:,"b"" You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid."""
Joey:,"b"" Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural \n  places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!"""
Ross:,"b"" You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship."""
Joey:,"b"" Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really \n  like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."""
Ross:,b' (after a short hesitation) Fine.'
Joey:,b' Thanks.'
Ross:,"b"" Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!"""
Joey:,b' The Metsss!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.'"
Joey:,"b"" (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're \n  gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, \n  and avoid all the confusion!"""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, most of it it's a place """
Joey:,"b"" Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison \n  Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? \n  You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there \n  there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love."""
Joey:,"b' Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!'"
Ross:,"b"" But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for \n  Thai food..."""
Joey:,"b' Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go'"
Ross:,b' Ok.'
Joey:,b' You got to tell me exactly what to do there.'
Ross:,"b"" Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities \n  wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."""
Joey:,"b"" Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make \n  the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the \n  right and Joey nods)"""
Chandler:,b' I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I \n  know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.'
Chandler:,"b' Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 \n  number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I guess!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, Come on!'"
Chandler:,b' Why are you here?'
Chandler:,"b' (to Heaven) No no no... I mean,'"
Chandler:,b' What!?'
Chandler:,"b"" I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got \n  a hot date... (starts to leave)"""
Chandler:,b' (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)'
Phoebe:,"b' (In a strange heavy accent) Hello ""ja"", it\'s time \n  for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her \n  head in the hole and Phoebe enters)'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, then I'm Swedish..."""
Phoebe:,"b"" It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea..."""
Rachel:,b' Oh... what an interesting name.'
Phoebe:,b' Ja!'
Rachel:,"b"" You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's \n  direction)"""
Phoebe:,b' (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!'
Rachel:,"b"" (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love \n  your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)"""
Phoebe:,b' Is something wrong?'
Rachel:,"b"" No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) \n  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?"""
Phoebe:,b' (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.'
Rachel:,b' Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!'
Joey:,b' (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines \n  and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors \n  as his elusive subject was light itself.'
Ross:,"b' Now, do you have any idea what you just said?'"
Joey:,"b' (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth \n  says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!'"
Ross:,"b' Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt \n  M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.'"
Joey:,b' Phonetically? (Looks confused)'
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time \n  for this."""
Joey:,b' Ok.'
Ross:,"b"" Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that \n  you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"""
Joey:,"b' Ah! I\'m an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" \n  I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".'"
Ross:,b' Wow. What does'
Joey:,"b' No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I \n  guess it means ""you\'re gonna get eaten by a bear"".'"
Ross:,"b"" Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?"""
Joey:,"b"" Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish \n  of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the \n  imaginary painting)."""
Ross:,"b"" Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing \n  and dude, you can't"""
Joey:,b' Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)'
Ross:,b' No! (Slaps his hand)'
Chandler:,"b"" (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the \n  room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. \n  Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees \n  Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?"""
Chandler:,b' Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!'
Chandler:,"b"" I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... \n  I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok."""
Chandler:,"b"" (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there \n  is a reason why we can't have a baby?"""
Chandler:,"b"" (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe \n  I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... \n  come here and do... 'that'..."""
Chandler:,"b' (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a ""Wendy\'s!! \n  ""'"
Phoebe:,"b' (Singing) ""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is \n  the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have \n  a friend who is a masseuse.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, Ja! Ja!'"
Rachel:,"b"" Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?'"
Rachel:,"b"" I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy \n  fingers from playing crummy guitar..."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're \n  such a high maintenance tight ass!"""
Rachel:,b' (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!'
Phoebe:,"b"" You know it's me?"""
Rachel:,"b' For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!'"
Phoebe:,b' How can you come here?'
Rachel:,b' How could you not tell me you worked here?'
Phoebe:,"b"" I don't have to tell you everything!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting \n  a free massage!"""
Phoebe:,b' Tips not included.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then \n  they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... \n  you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and"""
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there \n  right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles \n  and I'"
Phoebe:,b' You know what? You are right. I'
Rachel:,b' Good for you Pheebs!'
Phoebe:,b' Ok.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and \n  whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean"""
Ross:,"b' Haha! Got ya! Die, die,'"
Ross:,"b' (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor \n  R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the \n  sofa) Hey!'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, how was the Met?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?'"
Ross:,b' What do you mean?'
Ross:,"b' (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked \n  into the Met, did you go to the right?'"
Ross:,"b' (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like \n  you guys are having a great time together.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b' What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.'"
Ross:,"b"" (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey \n  a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about \n  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."""
Ross:,"b"" And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all \n  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the \n  kind of guy Joey is."""
Ross:,b' That was going to be my next argument.'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b"" (to Charlie) You're ready?"""
Joey:,"b' (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me \n  up.'"
Ross:,b' Glad I could help man.'
Joey:,"b"" Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna \n  be, but... (confidently) I made it work."""
Chandler:,"b"" (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited \n  his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now."""
Chandler:,"b"" Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here \n  but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile \n  fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) \n  Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)"""
Chandler:,b' Doctor Connelly just called.'
Chandler:,"b"" Actually it's both of us."""
Chandler:,b' Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable \n  environment.'
Chandler:,"b"" It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and \n  you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means..."""
Chandler:,"b"" (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's \n  a good chance this may never happen for us."""
Chandler:,"b"" I'm sorry."""
Chandler:,"b"" Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."""
Phoebe:,"b"" (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist."""
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?'"
Phoebe:,"b' (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for \n  your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.'"
