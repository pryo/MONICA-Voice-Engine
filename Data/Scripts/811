Rachel:,b' Phoebe?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,"b' Look at that guy by the window, wow!'"
Phoebe:,"b' He\x92s awfully short and I think he\x92s talking to himself. And to\nbe completely honest, he\x92s not that good in bed.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it\x92s like every guy I\nsee\x97I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean\nnormally that\x92s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the\nway I\x92m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start\ngoing crazy.'"
Rachel:,b' Really?! So this has happened to you?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so\nin, y\x92know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store\nsitting on Santa\x92s lap.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander\nHolyfield from a '"
Rachel:,b' Ah.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, y\x92know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I\x92ll ask her\nabout this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. Yeah, that\x92s what you need a good\x85pill.'"
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona\nice skating?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.\n(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn\x92t move from his\nchair.)'"
Ross:,b' Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us\ntogether?'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m missin\x92 picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at\nhim and he retreats.)'"
Phoebe:,b' (sitting down next to Ross) Y\x92know she has a face Ross!'
Ross:,"b' Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card\ny\x92know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.'"
Ross:,b' (pause) Together? Like-like to people?'
Ross:,b' Okay. (Not happy about it.)'
Ross:,"b' Uh sure, sure.'"
Phoebe:,b' Bye.'
Joey:,b' (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!'
Ross:,b' I know. Can you believe that?'
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, I\x92m-I\x92m sorry. What\x92s the big deal about a holiday\ncard?'"
Ross:,"b' Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have\nbeen dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!'"
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey-hey, hey that\x92s your wife you\x92re talking about!'"
Chandler:,"b' Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?'"
Chandler:,"b' I didn\x92t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I\x92m\nsorry.'"
Chandler:,b' No.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts '"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Huh. Wow, this is great.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, we-we haven\x92t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay\nto say it to other people.'"
Ross:,"b' A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I\x92ll take a\x97Mona, uh\x85I-I\x92m\nnot sure about the whole uh, card thing.'"
Ross:,"b' Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don\x92t know if\nwe\x92re really quite there yet.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Huh.'
Ross:,b' Hmm\x85'
Ross:,b' Let\x92s do the card!'
Ross:,b' The card! I think we\x92re there!'
Ross:,"b' Really?! I mean, even with the card?'"
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy\nwho took my blood sample really cute? Y\x92know who I\x92m talking about, bald\nhaircut, hairy fingers\x85 (Stops when she realizes it was her.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes, you are.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are\nyou from? What do you do?'"
Rachel:,"b' Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you\nski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!'"
Rachel:,b' No. I\x92m very comfortable.'
Rachel:,"b' No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!'"
Rachel:,b' Well would you like me to lie down on the table?'
Rachel:,b' Do you feel it too?'
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh hey! So, how did your doctor\x92s appointment go?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, let\x92s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the\nmiddle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my\nfourth month of\npregnancy?'"
Phoebe:,b' You wish.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh yeah? Come and get it.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, even this is turning me on!'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how\x92s it, how\x92s it going with you and\nMona? Are you guys still together?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah, yeah we\x92re moving forward. You\x92ll be getting our card!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, we\x92re not just doing a card! Y\x92know, she-she also wants to\nhave the conversation about where the relationship is going.'"
Phoebe:,b' Ugh! Women!'
Ross:,"b' I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I\nmean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?""'"
Rachel:,b' Uh Ross? You asked me that.'
Ross:,"b' Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I\x92m not a mind reader! Besides, I\nhate those conversations. I\x92m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a\ngesture. Y\x92know, something that says we\x92re moving forward without having to talk\nabout it.'"
Ross:,b' Smaller than that.'
Ross:,"b' Uh, bigger than that.'"
Phoebe:,b' Give her a key to your apartment.'
Ross:,b' Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah I-I don\x92t-I don\x92t think I\x92m quite there yet, but I\ncould say I looove spending time with you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, we hate that.'"
Ross:,"b' Forget it. I-I\x97Y\x92know what? I\x92ll just have the\nconversation. I\x92ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.\nWhat do you think Rach?'"
Rachel:,"b' I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples\nthrough that sweater.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh uh, as it turns out, we can\x92t do it. Monica has to work.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh uh well tomorrow\x92s no good for her either.'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s the semi-finals\x85of her\x85botchy ball tournament.'
Chandler:,b' Well now-now you\x92re just talking crazy.'
Chandler:,b' Because uh\x85we-we\x85we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold\nme.'
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know what would really help me through this tough time is\nchoking something. Can I choke ya?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with\nthat bitch.'"
Ross:,"b' Here we go. Mona umm, I think it\x92s time we-we had a conversation\nabout-about where things are with us.'"
Ross:,"b' Aw, we-we are so\x85(Motions that they\x92re connected.) So umm, well\nI-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y\x92know hanging out with you. And I mean-I\x92m\nhaving a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there\nisn\x92t.)'"
Ross:,"b' I mean, there\x92s no point in spending time with someone if-if\nit\x92s just fun. It\x92s gotta be, it\x92s gotta be going somewhere right? So\nwhere-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That\x92s-that\x92s the real question. And-and\nthe answer is\x85is it\x92s going somewhere\x85fun. Now I-I know what you\x92re\nthinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y\x92know, but you\x92re-you\x92re\nnot getting any younger. No I mean\x97No not you, not you, you\x97you '"
Ross:,"b' Well, well to sum up, we\x92re having fun, you look young.'"
Ross:,b' But that\x92s not enough. So\x85 So\x85here\x92s a key to my\napartment. (Hands her his key.)'
Ross:,b' Really.'
Rachel:,b' You gave her a key to your apartment?!'
Ross:,"b' Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a\nvery serious relationship.'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How\x92d the conversation go?'
Ross:,"b' Oh great, I live on the street.'"
Phoebe:,b' Where?! (Ross exits.)'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.'"
Phoebe:,"b' So umm, I\x92m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me\nout?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, he\x92s here to have sex with you.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re welcome.'
Rachel:,b' Phoebe no!'
Phoebe:,"b' It\x92s okay, he\x92s a virgin.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, okay let\x92s leave these two alone.'"
Rachel:,"b' No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do\nit with some random guy!'"
Phoebe:,b' Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!\n(Phoebe exits.)'
Chandler:,"b' Oh that\x92s all right sir, and that\x92s just one girl.'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s a hand. It\x92s a thing you use as a '
Chandler:,b' Oh no-no-no!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, and oh I\x92m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give\nthem away for no reason at all.'"
Ross:,b' No. That guy is.'
Ross:,b' I\x92m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.'
Ross:,b' I love you!'
Chandler:,b' Hi honey I\x92m home.'
Chandler:,"b' It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that\nyou and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then\nwhen I wouldn\x92t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!'"
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would\nbe like without you. It was like '
Chandler:,"b' Ooh, I don\x92t know if we\x92re there yet.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes. Hi, I\x92d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?\nIs-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very '"
Joey:,b' Who was that?'
Rachel:,b' It\x92s just the pizza place.'
Joey:,b' You hung up on the pizza place? I don\x92t hang up on your friends.'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry honey, I\x92m just having a, having a rough day.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, what\x92s wrong?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh you really, you really just don\x92t want to hear about it.'"
Joey:,b' Then why did I ask?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, it\x92s just\x97and this is really embarrassing\x97but\nlately with this whole pregnancy thing I\x92m just finding myself\x85how do I put this\numm, erotically charged.'"
Joey:,b' Is that college talk for horny?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah. So y\x92know, I have all of these feelings and I don\x92t know\nwhat to do about them, because I can\x92t date like a normal person, which is fine\nbecause I don\x92t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.\nJust sex, y\x92know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel\ncomfortable with and who knows what he\x92s doing. For just one great night, I mean is\nthat really so\x85hard\x85to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?'"
Joey:,"b' Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I gotta get up early and it\x92s almost seven o\x92clock.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, good night!'"
Joey:,b' Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)'
Joey:,b' (entering) I can\x92t do it!'
Rachel:,b' (entering) I didn\x92t ask you to do it!'
Joey:,b' You\x92re Rachel!'
Rachel:,b' You\x92re Joey!'
Joey:,b' You\x92re my friend!'
Rachel:,b' Right back at ya!'
Joey:,"b' But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.'"
Rachel:,b' And so bad. I don\x92t even know what you\x92re talking about\nbecause I didn\x92t ask you to do anything!'
Joey:,b' I know!'
Joey:,b' Do you wanna do it?'
Rachel:,b' No!'
Joey:,"b' All right, me neither! I was just testing you!'"
Rachel:,b' That\x92s the end of this conversation!'
Joey:,b' This conversation never happened!'
Rachel:,b' Never happened! Good night!'
Joey:,b' Good night!'
Joey:,b' Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Hi. Listen, I\x92m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really\nwasn\x92t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something\nthat I think you\x92ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the\nEvander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I\x92m gonna, I\x92m gonna\nwant him back. So\x85 (Looks at him longingly) I\x92m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)\n(Entering) I\x92m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can\x92t! (She grabs the cutout\nand exits for good.)'"
