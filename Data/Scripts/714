Ross:,b' Happy birthday!!!'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) She\x92s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.'
Joey:,b' They do!'
Phoebe:,b' Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!'
Ross:,b' We\x92ve got presents!'
Rachel:,b' Good ones?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?'"
Joey:,"b' Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.'"
Ross:,b' Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?'
Joey:,b' (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not\nme!! (He buries his head in Phoebe\x92s lap for comfort.)'
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, I\x92m still 29 in Guam.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?'"
Rachel:,b' Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to\nthis?'
Chandler:,"b' No Rach, it\x92s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly\nwasn\x92t that much fun.'"
Joey:,b' (screaming) And now Chandler! We\x92re all gettin\x92 so old! (Looking\nup) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star.'"
Rachel:,"b' Look, y\x92know I know my life\x92s going pretty well, but I look\naround and I just see so many people who\x92ve accomplished so many other goals by the\ntime they\x92re thirty.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but you shouldn\x92t compare yourself to me.'"
Rachel:,b' There you go!'
Phoebe:,"b' I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That\x92s it!! That\x92s\neverything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with\nmy sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a\nGodsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head\ninto Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs.\nKreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!'"
Rachel:,b' Nothing. I don\x92t want to do anything.'
Ross:,b' Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation!\nOkay? I-I have a child!'
Ross:,"b' How hot do I look in this, huh?!'"
Chandler:,"b' Ross, a sports car? Wouldn\x92t it have been cheaper to just stuff a\nsock down there?'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I\nhave '
Joey:,"b' Hey, what\x92s the horsepower on this thing?'"
Ross:,"b' (giddy) I don\x92t know, but-but look how shiny!'"
Rachel:,"b' Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know\nit\x92s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?'"
Ross:,b' Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. '
Ross:,b' Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (getting out) Okay, who\x92s next?'"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know what? I am going to do something today. I\x92m not just\ngonna sit around like some old lady. I\x92m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh,\nlike my nose or my tongue or something.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really?! \x91Cause y\x92know that hurts.'
Rachel:,b' So what?! Y\x92know what? The way I see it\x97(Phoebe pulls out a\nhair from the back of her head)\x97Ow! Son of a bitch!!'
Rachel:,"b' (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment. '"
Phoebe:,b' Least of all you.'
Chandler:,b' (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica\x92s gonna be here any\nminute!'
Joey:,b' But it hurt\x92s my Joey\x92s Apple.'
Chandler:,"b' (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. It\x92s not named for each\nindividual man.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can\x92t believe that you\nwould have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can\x92t believe that\nyou would have a tux that\x92s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller\x92s\nshoulder.)'"
Chandler:,b' Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She\x92s coming!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the\nlights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the\nassemblage.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out\nwhat\x92s going on.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey-hey are you drunk?'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a '"
Chandler:,b' Yes!'
Chandler:,b' Yes!!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, here\x92s the thing. We\x92re gonna get you some coffee and\nthey will never know that you\x92re drunk.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ll take care of it.'"
Chandler:,b' (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.'
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s still yours. Okay, now remember it\x92s a surprise\nparty. So, when you go in, act surprised.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, forward. Forward\x97Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to\nthe back of the car.) Okay, back\x97Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to\nthe front.) Okay, forward\x97Stop! Stop! Stop!'"
Joey:,b' Well actually\x85'
Ross:,b' No-no-no! It\x92s mine! It\x92s-it\x92s mine. (The woman walks\naway.)'
Joey:,"b' Dude, you soooo need this car.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (running up) Okay. Okay, here\x92s what we\x92re gonna do. Okay,\nI\x92m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so\nRoss can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and\nreveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel.\nShe inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!!\n(Runs off.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It\x92s\nfor the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!'"
Phoebe:,b' Because it\x92s our thirtieth birthday.'
Phoebe:,b' Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. What?!'
Phoebe:,b' Nu-uh!'
Phoebe:,b' You have your birth certificate?'
Phoebe:,b' Our mom.'
Phoebe:,b' Do you have my birth certificate?'
Phoebe:,"b' (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.'"
Phoebe:,b' I just lost a whole year of my life.'
Phoebe:,b' Your middle name is Pamela?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s my first name.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her\nparty dress.'"
Chandler:,"b' See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room,\nand has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who\x92s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller\nwho\x92s standing next to him.)'"
Chandler:,b' (correcting her) Phil.'
Chandler:,"b' Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the\nsteps.) Okay, (catches her) you\x92re doing great. You\x92re doing great. You\x92re\ndoing fine.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, what\x92s going on?'"
Chandler:,b' Monica\x92s a little drunk.'
Phoebe:,b' Yay! I '
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn\x92t want her parents\nto know she\x92s drunk.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh! All right! All right. Here\x92s what we\x92ll do, I\x92ll get\ntwice as drunk as Monica and then no one will even notice her.'"
Rachel:,b' What\x92s-what\x92s going on? Phil\x92s really pissed!'
Chandler:,b' Monica\x92s wasted.'
Ross:,b' Maybe that will liven up this party.'
Chandler:,"b' (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.'"
Joey:,"b' Yep. (Starts for Monica\x92s room, but Chandler stops him.)'"
Rachel:,b' Ahh!'
Rachel:,b' (opening it) A scooter! (She\x92s not happy.)'
Ross:,b' (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.'
Rachel:,"b' No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.) '"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Now that you\x92re a couple, we don\x92t get two presents from you\nguys?'"
Chandler:,b' For my last birthday you gave me a '
Rachel:,"b' Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It\x92s\nbetter to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as\neveryone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That\x92s funny,\nyeah!'"
Chandler:,b' No-no-no-no! That was the joke!'
Rachel:,"b' (crying) No, I know! I get it! It\x92s funny!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, because you\x92re not a grandmother!'"
Rachel:,"b' No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have\nchildren and I don\x92t have any of those things. That\x92s why it\x92s so funny.\n(Runs into her room crying.)'"
Ross:,b' Hey! Look who\x92s back! It\x92s the birthday girl! How\x92s the\nbirthday girl feeling?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I feel fine, but I think you\x92re bumming out the rest of the\nkids.'"
Ross:,"b' What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes\nand sits down.)'"
Rachel:,b' Okay! Y\x92know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not\nhaving a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three\nkids\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you\nwanna have them for your brother.'"
Rachel:,b' As I was saying\x85 I should probably have the first of the three kids\nby the time I\x92m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this\nplan!'
Phoebe:,"b' If you could do that, I\x92d marry the hippity-hop.'"
Rachel:,"b' So, if I wanna have my kid when I\x92m 35, I don\x92t have to get\npregnant until I\x92m 34. Which gives '"
Rachel:,"b' No, so I don\x92t have to get married until I\x92m 33! That\x92s\nthree years, that\x92s three whole years\x97Oh, wait a minute though. I\x92ll need a\nyear and a half to plan the wedding, and I\x92d like to know the guy for a year, year\nand a half before we get engaged\x85 Which means I need to meet the guy by the time\nI\x92m thirty.'"
Ross:,b' Which is fine! Because '
Rachel:,"b' No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should\nalready be with the guy I wanna marry!'"
Joey:,b' Will you quit hoggin\x92 it!'
Rachel:,b' (To Chandler) I\x92m telling you it\x92s like watching Bambi learn\nhow to walk.'
Ross:,b' (To Monica) You\x92re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe\nI\x92m a little drunk.'
Chandler:,b' (to a waiter) Oh that\x92s great! Right there! Can we get some of\nthat over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.'
Joey:,b' (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not\ntell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?'
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) How are you feeling?'
Ross:,b' I really wish that you wouldn\x92t.'
Chandler:,"b' (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit\nmore, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don\x92t talk to '"
Phoebe:,b' (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let\x92s hear from the\nbirthday girl! Huh?'
Chandler:,b' Pheebs!!'
Phoebe:,b' Don\x92t you see? Everyone\x92s looking at me! The plan\x92s\nworking! I didn\x92t even have to take off my top yet!'
Ross:,b' Come on!'
Chandler:,b' I think it\x92s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)'
Phoebe:,b' (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)'"
Joey:,b' Yeah!!'
Phoebe:,b' I lost a whole year! I can\x92t believe it! This is so unfair!'
Joey:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t know Pheebs. It\x92ll be okay.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were\n31?'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!'
Phoebe:,"b' Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I\x85I haven\x92t done any of\nthe things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!'"
Joey:,b' Like what?'
Phoebe:,"b' Like okay I-I-I, I haven\x92t met any Portuguese people! I, I\nhaven\x92t had the perfect kiss! And I haven\x92t been to sniper\x92s school!'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I\x92ll\nsee you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what you guys? I think I\x92m gonna go walk her home.\n(Gets up and runs out.) '"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and\nJoey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that\x92s one thing you can cross off your list.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, and plus I\x92m 1/16'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)'
Ross:,"b' Okay, is everybody clear? We\x92re gonna pick it up\x85and move it.\nNow all we need is teamwork, okay? We\x92re gonna '"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, I really don\x92t think\x85'"
Ross:,b' (interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, here we go.'"
Ross:,"b' All right everyone, lift! (They try to lift the car, of course it\ndoesn\x92t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey Joey, can I\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!'"
Rachel:,"b' Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?'"
Rachel:,"b' Whatever! Okay, I\x92m not your mother.'"
Joey:,b' Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)'
Rachel:,b' Not in the street!!'
Joey:,b' Yes!'
Rachel:,b' (to Tag) Hi.'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m doing okay. I\x92m um\x85let\x92s talk.'"
Rachel:,b' Umm\x85'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh Tag, umm\x85you\x92re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun\ntogether but I don\x92t-I don\x92t\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but\nI just think I\x92m past the point where I think I can y\x92know, just have fun.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, it is! But you\x92re just a kid! I mean you\x92re 25!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh God! Y\x92know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well\nactually, if I\x92m wishin\x92 for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m sorry. (They hug.)'"
Chandler:,b' Hey! How\x92d it go?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?'"
Phoebe:,b' You did the right thing.'
Joey:,"b' (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don\x92t like this anymore.\n(He sits down with them in pain.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.'"
Ross:,"b' God, do you realize in ten years we\x92re gonna be 40?'"
Joey:,b' (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in\nRoss\x92s shoulder.)'
Ross:,b' Yes! My baby\x92s finally free! '
Joey:,b' All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let\x92s go!'

Joey:,b' No.'
