Phoebe:,b' How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?'
Rachel:,b' (pause) He\x92s talking to the baby.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can\x92t wait to\nhear your first words,"" I thought, ""There\x92s a trick.""'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I\x92ll see you later.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Bye.'

Rachel:,"b' No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore '"
Joey:,"b' No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she\x92s\nreally interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y\x92know, to\ngive her some advice.'"
Rachel:,b' I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors\x85'
Joey:,"b' Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!'"
Rachel:,b' Really?! Oh my God! I\x92m successful!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, so will you meet with her?'"
Rachel:,b' Yes! I\x92d love to! Have her come by the office.'

Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' She took \x91em!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey Ross! Doesn\x92t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?'
Ross:,b' Yeah. Why?'
Phoebe:,b' Sting has a son that goes there too!'
Ross:,b' Yeah I know; he\x92s in Ben\x92s class.'
Phoebe:,b' You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur\nstuff you tell us?!'
Ross:,b' Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to\nsit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Sting\x92s son, seven years old and there\x92s a picture.'"
Ross:,b' What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, it\x92s '"
Ross:,"b' Uh, I actually haven\x92t even met him.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, yeah that\x92s too bad. I really want to go to his concert\nFriday night, but it\x92s totally sold out. I know! Why don\x92t you meet him and get\ntickets?! If you get two I\x92ll take you.'"
Ross:,"b' Well actually, I\x92m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he\x92ll be\nthere.'"
Phoebe:,"b' There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting\ntomorrow! '"
Chandler:,b' Hey-hey.'
Rachel:,b' Hi Monica!'
Rachel:,b' Hi boots.'
Chandler:,b' You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to\npay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)'
Phoebe:,b' Wow! They\x92re beautiful!'
Rachel:,b' Ahh\x85'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,b' Well-well you can give them to me! I haven\x92t felt my feet in years!'
Phoebe:,b' Well then get your money back and return them!'
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' (returning to his seat) Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school\x85'
Chandler:,b' (spinning around looking for him) I don\x92t think you did a very\nthorough job!'
Ross:,"b' I dropped him off at Carol\x92s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that\nI\x92m not going to be able to get those tickets though.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh no! Why not?'
Ross:,b' Well it turns out that Ben and Sting\x92s son do not get along.'
Phoebe:,b' How come?!'
Ross:,"b' Apparently, Sting\x92s son made fun of the fact that Ben\x92s moms are\nlesbinims.'"
Phoebe:,b' Wait! But Ross if they don\x92t get along then '
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, you can\x92t force kids to be friends.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!'"
Ross:,b' Playpen?! Ben\x92s seven!'
Phoebe:,"b' Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, ""Yes."") (To the rest)\nHe\x92s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!'"
Ross:,"b' Look I\x92m sorry Pheebs, I can\x92t do it.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes you can! Sting says so himself!'
Ross:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' (singing) '
Ross:,"b' Look Phoebe, I\x92m sorry it\x92s just\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' (singing) '
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, I\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' (singing) '
Joey:,"b' (entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh Joey, I\x92m hardly a\x85'"
Joey:,b' My little sister Dina!'
Rachel:,b' Right! Hi Dina! '
Rachel:,b' Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)'
Joey:,"b' This is so exciting for her. Well, I\x92ll let you two fash\x85ists\nget down to business. (Exits.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. All right Dina, well let\x92s talk about the different areas of\nfashion that you could get involved in. Let\x92s see, there\x92s design, but you may\nneed a whole other degree for that. Uh, there\x92s-there\x92s sales, which is great\nbecause you get to travel\x85'"
Rachel:,b' (stunned) And there\x92s marketing\x85'
Chandler:,b' (opening the door) What\x92s wrong?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh don\x92t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go\ninto the apartment.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Now sweetie, I know you don\x92t like my office parties, but you can\nwear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a\x85supple leather lining.'"
Chandler:,b' Why not?'
Chandler:,b' Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?'
Chandler:,"b' You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with\nskirts, dresses, and pants!'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' Honey, it\x92s going to be okay. He\x92s been incredibly supportive\nof me, and if he gets a little upset; that\x92s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives\nDina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,b' Hey! It\x92s my fashion girls! (They don\x92t react.) What\x92s\nwrong?'
Rachel:,"b' Honey, why don\x92t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to\ntell you.'"
Joey:,"b' (concerned) Oh. What\x92s, what\x92s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick?\nIs it dad\x92s heart? Is that a sandwich?'"
Joey:,b' Is that a sandwich?!'
Rachel:,b' Joey\x85there\x92s something that you\x85should know. Dina?'
Joey:,b' (angrily) What?!'
Rachel:,b' (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She\nquickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)'
Joey:,b' Well obviously this is a mistake! You can\x92t be pregnant! Because you\nhave to have sex to get pregnant!'
Rachel:,b' What?! Dina\x85'
Joey:,b' (to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I\ncan\x92t believe this! You\x92re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who\ndid this to you?!'
Joey:,b' You got pregnant for funny?! Dina\x85if he\x92s funny\x85'
Joey:,b' I can\x92t look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)'
Rachel:,b' I know.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, there you are Ben!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I heard you\x92re having a problem with one of the boys in your\nclass. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little\ntalk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy\x92s name is Sting\x92s son.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they\nhave famous fathers.'"
Phoebe:,b' Him you\x92re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to\nfind Jack and a teacher notices her.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Yes! Yes you can, I\x92m looking for Jack\x92s parents.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, I\x92m with Ben.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I am one of Ben\x92s mothers. I\x92m a lesbian. It was, it was\ndifficult coming out to my parents.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,b' Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! Let\x92s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and\ntalk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? \x91Cause Carol\nthrew it out, she lost ours. She\x92s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of\nass.'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know, that party wasn\x92t bad.'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?'"
Chandler:,"b' What honey, it\x92s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let\x92s\ngo.'"
Chandler:,b' What\x92s going on?'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause)\nIt\x92s oddly unsettling.'
Chandler:,b' Hop on.'
Chandler:,"b' Honey, I know you\x92re in pain right now, but I\x92m a little\nturned on.'"
Rachel:,b' What college was that Dina?'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, what are you doing?'"
Joey:,"b' Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join\nthis man and this woman\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Oh Joey this is crazy!'
Joey:,"b' Don\x92t interrupt me when I\x92m talkin\x92 to God! Now where were\nwe? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man\x85'"
Joey:,b' Oh you\x92ll take \x91em!'
Joey:,b' Hey! You don\x92t get a say in this!'
Joey:,"b' Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we\x92re halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby)\nYou!'"
Rachel:,"b' All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby\nand Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it\x92s not legal. Okay?\nThey-they don\x92t have a marriage license, they don\x92t have any witnesses, and the\ngroom only has on one shoe!'"
Joey:,b' Well what am I supposed to do?'
Rachel:,b' You\x92re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can\nmake their own decisions.'
Joey:,b' No they can\x92t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!'
Rachel:,b' Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)\nRight?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, come on kids! A little help here!'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting\x92s pen\x85that he\ngave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase)\nCome on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)'
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,b' Why else would I be here?'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, I\x92m sorry. Won\x92t-won\x92t Jack\x92s father be joining\nus?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night\nperhaps at 8 o\x92clock?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Concert. Yeah. That does put us in\x85quite a pickle. Because you see\nI\x92m very busy before and after the concert, and he\x92s obviously busy during.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,\nall the while thinking about the children of course.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, thank you. Four would be great.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh good! Then you\x92re in luck! Ben\x92s not my son!'
Phoebe:,b' The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh I\x92m sorry! Do you need a break?'
Chandler:,b' I can see it from right here. It\x92ll cost you one husband.'
Chandler:,b' (pause) I don\x92t have your boots.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, why don\x92t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on\na bale of hay!'"
Chandler:,"b' Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?'"
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, just because they\x92re not getting married doesn\x92t mean\nthis is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!'"
Joey:,"b' Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let\x92s hear their plan! Now, what\x92s the\nfuture look like for Dina and Bobby?'"
Joey:,b' (to Dina) You were right. He is funny.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you\nwanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don\x92t you tell us a\nlittle bit about your band?'"
Rachel:,b' (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)'
Joey:,"b' Dina, if you\x92re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to\nBobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that\x92s not a compliment!'"
Joey:,b' So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You\x92re gonna have the\nbaby and-and raise it by yourself\x85without a husband?! You can\x92t be a single\nmother alone! You\x92re gonna ruin your life!'
Rachel:,b' Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?'
Joey:,b' No! No! No! It\x92s different for you. You\x92re so strong and\ntogether. You\x92re not some dumb kid who doesn\x92t know what she\x92s doing.'
Joey:,"b' One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.'"
Rachel:,b' So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?'
Joey:,"b' Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well\x85so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb\nNuts\x97Oh forget it! I can\x92t!'"
Joey:,b' Because! \x91Cause\x85 \x91Cause you\x92re my baby sister!'
Joey:,"b' Well I\x92d be scared of them, but all right.'"
Joey:,b' Of course he\x92s gonna have his Uncle Joey!'
Joey:,b' That\x92s right! By his uncle too!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay Bobby, why don\x92t we just come over here and let them have a\nlittle moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)'"
Joey:,b' Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)'
Rachel:,b' No! Seriously! What\x92s wrong with you?!'
Ross:,b' You\x92re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!'
Ross:,b' Well\x85let\x92s just say\x85 (singing) '
Phoebe:,"b' Oo, where are the seats?'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, middle balcony.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, now would you say that that\x92s more than 50 yards away from\nSting, his wife, or a member of his family?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' Then that\x92s not breaking the law! I\x92m there!'
