Chandler:,b' Oh.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got\nso excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y\x92know, he screamed out '"

Ross:,"b' Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and\nmy Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, ""Why do\nthey call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did\nthat.'"
Chandler:,b' So you don\x92t have the cameras?!'
Ross:,b' No. Sorry man.'

Rachel:,b' Shh-shh-shh! The guys don\x92t know yet do they?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah that\x92s right Chandler does still think I\x92m pregnant. He\nhasn\x92t asked me how I\x92m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for\nthe woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.'"
Rachel:,"b' Don\x92t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a\nfew more hours, \x91cause I\x92m going to tell the father today.'"

Rachel:,b' Well then you have his baby.'
Phoebe:,b' Believe me I\x92m trying.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. You\x92re just gonna knock on his door and change his life\nforever. You\x92re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual\nmagnetism.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Pretty big? It\x92s huge! God, this guy doesn\x92t have a clue!\nHe\x92s just walking down the street thinking, \x91I had sex with Rachel Green. I\nrock!\x92 then bam! He\x92s a father and everything\x92s different.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well it\x92s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I\x92m not\ngonna ask him for anything.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he\x92s\nwalking around thinking, \x91Do I want to be a dad?\x92 and then bam!'"
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t. He got\x85he-he-he-he\x92s hit by a bus.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that\nshe was pregnant?'"
Joey:,b' (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have\nan accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that\nSunglass Hut!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh Joey! Joey! No, it\x92s not you! You didn\x92t get anybody\npregnant!'"
Joey:,b' Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.)\nIs somebody pregnant?'

Joey:,"b' Whoa, wait a minute. Who\x92s the father?'"
Phoebe:,b' You don\x92t know him. It\x92s not important. He wants nothing to do\nwith me or the baby. (She sits down like she\x92s pregnant.)'
Joey:,b' Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? \x91Cause I will track him down\nand kick his ass!'

Ross:,"b' Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager,\nno-one\x92s turned them.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well this is great. Y\x92know, those cameras were the only thing\nthat was gonna cheer Monica up today, she\x92s really depressed.'"
Ross:,"b' Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?'"
Chandler:,b' All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can\x92t\nbelieve I screwed this up!'
Ross:,b' I\x92m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here\x92s\na thought. This is the same ballroom. There\x92s a band. There\x92s gonna be plenty of\ndressed up people.'
Chandler:,b' Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?'
Ross:,"b' No-no-no, I\x92m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at\nthe gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make\nsure not to get anybody else\x92s faces.'"
Chandler:,b' Are you serious?'
Ross:,b' I\x92m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you\nreally want to start your life together by letting her down?'
Chandler:,b' Marriage advice? Really?!'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren\x92t\nthese the same flowers?'"

Phoebe:,"b' Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?'"
Rachel:,b' Not yet.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it\nGunther?'"

Rachel:,b' Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven\x92t told him yet and I\ndon\x92t think I can tell him at all now!'
Phoebe:,b' Why not?'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking,\n\x91I\x92m gonna tell the father today\x92 and then bam!'"
Phoebe:,b' Bus?'
Rachel:,"b' No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all\nis!'"
Phoebe:,b' Well-well but it is huge.'
Rachel:,"b' I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I\ndidn\x92t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.'"
Phoebe:,"b' You\x92re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it\nover with. It\x92s like, it\x92s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick\nand painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of\x85See?'"

Phoebe:,b' All right. (She sits down like she\x92s pregnant again.)'
Joey:,"b' Umm, now uh\x85 It\x92s a scary world out there, especially for a\nsingle mom. Y\x92know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so\x85 (He\ngoes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hell yeah! I\x92ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey lady, your day\x92s over! It\x92s my turn!'"
Joey:,b' Why?! Why can\x92t she marry me?!'
Phoebe:,b' I can and I will! (Kisses him.)'
Joey:,b' Oh my God.'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths \x91I love\nyou\x92 to him.)'

Chandler:,b' Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!'
Phoebe:,"b' Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called\nthe father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!'"
Rachel:,"b' What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I may play the fool at times, but I\x92m a little more than a pretty\nblond girl with an ass that won\x92t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I\nbelieve this belongs to the father of your baby.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh God\x85 Oh, he\x92s in there right now?'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the\nBand-Aid off. What to you want to do?'

Phoebe:,"b' Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that\nthis is your red sweater.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or\x85poison? No? Just for me?\nOkay. (Walks away.)'
