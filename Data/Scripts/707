Joey:,b' Pretty good.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a\nnaked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts\nJoey.)'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I\x92m late for work.'"
Rachel:,b' What-what?! You\x92re gonna leave this person with me?!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah\x97Hey, don\x92t worry, she\x92s a terrific girl. And hey\nlisten, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I\x92m\nnot looking for a serious relationship; that\x92d be great.'"
Rachel:,b' Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!'
Joey:,"b' Just casually slip it in, y\x92know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,\nI\x92m a loner\x97No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn\x92t want to get mixed up with\nthe likes of me.'"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know what? That\x92s a lot to remember, can\x92t I just tell\nher you\x92re a pig?'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, I\x92m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to\ndo it! He\x92d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he\x92d make extras and leave\n\x91em for me.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well forget it, I\x92m not telling that girl anything. That is not my\nresponsibility.'"
Joey:,"b' Fine! (Pause) Now, where\x92d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him\nout the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)'"
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.'"

Chandler:,b' Wow that\x92s actually pretty cool.'
Ross:,"b' (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there\x92s also a book here by a woman named\nWendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next\naisle.) What is that?'"
Chandler:,b' Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.'

Chandler:,"b' What do you think, she\x92s just gonna sit there quietly? You\ndon\x92t think she\x92s gonna want to make a toast? You don\x92t think she\x92s\ngonna want to grab the microphone and sing '"
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know what? It\x92s gonna be okay. Y\x92know what?\nShe\x92s probably not gonna even want to come.'

Joey:,"b' My beers?! Look you guys, she\x92s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good\ntime, but I just\x97I don\x92t see it going anywhere.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but you always say that.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.'"
Joey:,"b' Look, I\x92m sorry you guys, I-I just don\x92t think so.'"
Phoebe:,b' Whatever.'
Rachel:,b' Fine. (They start to walk away.)'

Rachel:,b' Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,b' '
Ross:,b' People are doing it in front of my book!'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m sorry?'
Ross:,"b' My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,\nand there were students makin\x92 babies right in the middle of the Paleontology\nsection!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?'
Ross:,"b' Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on\ncampus where students went to uh, fool around.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, there was. It was\x97there the corner of the library where-where\nall these dusty books that nobody ever read\x97Yes, there was.'"
Ross:,"b' Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it\x92s like uh-a thing!'"
Joey:,"b' Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?'"
Ross:,b' Oh for cryin\x92 out loud! (He storms out.)'
Joey:,"b' All right, so we should go catch our movie.'"
Rachel:,b' Well now what\x92s the rush?'
Joey:,b' I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.'

Rachel:,b' (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don\x92t you guys do\nsomething?!'
Joey:,"b' (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.'"
Ross:,"b' Excuse me. Hi, I\x92m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology\nsection, fifth floor, stack 437?'"
Ross:,b' No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian\nbrings his boss over.)'
Ross:,"b' Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the\nPaleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people\nare-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, fine. Fine! If-if I\x92m the only person with any appreciation of\nthe sanctity of the written word, I\x92ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to\ndo so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don\x92t you follow me!'"
Joey:,b' Hey.'

Phoebe:,"b' Yay!! Oh so, you\x92re not, you\x92re not mad at us anymore?'"
Joey:,"b' No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the\nfirst time we went out. Y\x92know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.'"
Phoebe:,b' Didn\x92t you sleep together?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves\nsandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if\nwe were ever\nto have kids, well that\x92s a\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin\x92 about having kids. Oh my\nJoey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don\x92t get married before I do.'"
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b' Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the\nwedding. Um, it\x92s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We\x92re not even sure\nwhy we\x92re having it.'"
Joey:,b' How can you say that?! The '
Joey:,b' What about Game 1 of the Series?'
Joey:,b' You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)\nI\x92ll be right back. '
Rachel:,b' So how\x92s it goin\x92 with Joey?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me\nthat you like him.'"
Rachel:,b' But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just\nchange your mind?!'
Phoebe:,b' Then change it back!'
Phoebe:,b' No spark? Didn\x92t you sleep together?'
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, tramp!'"
Phoebe:,b' Does Joey have any idea?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, you mean like that you\x92re kind of a loner.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, and maybe that you\x92re a real (She says something in Italian,\nand it doesn\x92t matter what she said. It\x92s not important so I don\x92t need\neveryone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh well, I guess Italian isn\x92t one of the four languages you speak.'"
Joey:,b' (returning) Hey! You wanna go?'
Joey:,b' Okay. See you guys later.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, see ya.'"
Joey:,"b' (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, just a regular old flying dwarf.'"
Ross:,b' Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?'
Ross:,"b' Oh-oh, you\x92re-you\x92re fellow scholars. What exactly were you\nlooking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester\nStock\x92s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?'"
Ross:,"b' Ah\x85 Ah\x85Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts\nlooking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the\nsection.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion\x92s views\non evolution?'"
Ross:,b' I find Marion\x92s views far too progressionist.'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m a professor here uh, Ross\x85Geller.'"
Ross:,b' Yes! You\x92re the person who checked out my book?!'
Ross:,"b' Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.'"

Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' So how was, how was your date?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this\nice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still\x85 And guess what, I\x92m\nthinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?'
Joey:,"b' No-no-no-no-no! It\x92s a surprise, but it\x92s gonna be tricky\nthough because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.'"
Rachel:,"b' Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the\nfeeling from her today that uh, she\x92s not lookin\x92 for a serious relationship.'"
Joey:,b' Where are you gettin\x92 this?'

Joey:,"b' No! No. Don\x92t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.'"
Rachel:,b' Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?'

Chandler:,b' Is that what you\x92re thinking about right now?'
Chandler:,"b' Janice, I\x92m sorry but umm, you can\x92t stay here tonight.'"
Chandler:,"b' Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now\nMonica and I have been immunized, but sadly '"
Chandler:,b' Say again?'
Chandler:,"b' Feelings, such strong feelings.'"
Ross:,"b' (to the guard) Don\x92t sweat it, I\x92ve got this section covered.\nYeah, in fact I\x92ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in\npeople\x92s eye\x97(The guard walks away)\x97Okay, see you later. '"
Chandler:,b' I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)'
