Ross:,"b"" Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. """
Ross:,"b"" 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?'"
Ross:,b' My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.'
Phoebe:,b' That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?'
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."""
Ross:,"b"" Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is\nkinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really\ncool way to live'."""
Phoebe:,"b"" So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs\nabout my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."""
Chandler:,b' Might wanna open with the snowman.'
Joey:,"b"" Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."""
Ross:,b' How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.'
Joey:,"b"" I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even\njolly, it's all political."""
Joey:,"b"" Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,\ny'know?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all\nprotest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible\npressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can\nhave someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so\nI'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. """
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, you wish!'"
Chandler:,"b"" It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.\nI say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."""
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. """
Rachel:,"b"" Phoebe, you're on."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, oh, good.'"
Rachel:,"b' (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular\ndemand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot\nto me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:) '"
Phoebe:,b' (Sung) '
Phoebe:,b' (Sung) '
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then\nI assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"""
Chandler:,"b"" (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!"""
Phoebe:,b' Could you speak up please?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)"""
Joey:,"b"" Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"""
Ross:,"b' Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)'"
Rachel:,"b"" Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my\nsixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just\nshare too much?"""
Ross:,b' Just a smidge.'
Phoebe:,"b"" David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."""
Phoebe:,b' Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except\nhe-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the\ntime. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... """
Chandler:,"b"" Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna\nask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the\npact."""
Phoebe:,"b' No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."""
Ross:,"b"" C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! """
Chandler:,"b"" I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."""
Chandler:,"b"" I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"""
Joey:,"b"" Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."""
Chandler:,b' Too many jokes... must mock Joey! '
Joey:,"b' Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)'"
Chandler:,"b"" Aah, y'killing me!"""
Ross:,"b"" Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"""
Ross:,"b"" I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this\nmorning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,\nand he- he threw some faeces..."""
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're\nthere to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."""
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."""
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, alright, I have a question, then. '"
Phoebe:,"b' Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?'"
Phoebe:,b' Sure.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a\nsweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and\nthrow me. """
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, right now.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. """
Phoebe:,b' I can hop. (She hops onto the table)'
Ross:,"b"" So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?"""
Chandler:,b' Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?'
Joey:,b' You know more than one Fun Bobby?'
Chandler:,b' I happen to know a Fun Bob.'
Rachel:,"b' (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...'"
Joey:,"b"" Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"""
Rachel:,b' (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, four.'"
Ross:,b' Four.'
Rachel:,b' Five.'
Ross:,b' Five. (Buries his head in his hands)'
Rachel:,"b"" Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to\ndo?"""
Ross:,"b"" Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball\ndrops?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's\nwith who."""
Ross:,"b"" Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking\naround all the time dragging his hands... """
Chandler:,"b"" That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."""
Ross:,b' Really.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.'"
Ross:,"b' What, uh... what juggling thing?'"
Chandler:,b' With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.'
Ross:,b' No.'
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a\nmelon..."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" No, no, he hasn't been around."""
Phoebe:,b' Minsk?'
Phoebe:,b' I know where Minsk is.'
Phoebe:,"b' So when, when do you leave?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hello?'
Phoebe:,b' Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)\ncongratulations! This is so exciting!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" So-so you're really not going?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh don't do that."""
Phoebe:,b' Oh no no.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, but I can't do that-"""
Phoebe:,"b"" It's your thing, and-"""
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, um, stay.'"
Phoebe:,b' Stay.'
Phoebe:,b' Getting so good at that! (She hops on)'
Chandler:,b' You remember Janice.'
Joey:,"b"" Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger\ngirl)...You brought your kids."""
Ross:,b' Par-tay! '
Ross:,"b"" 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you\nsomething, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your\nhome?"""
Ross:,b' Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to\nhave the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...'
Ross:,"b"" Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a\nlittle mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."""
Rachel:,b' Rome. Jerk missed his flight.'
Phoebe:,b' And then... your face is bloated?'
Rachel:,"b"" No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-\nthis blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her\ncab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my\nhair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm\ngoing to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my\nwhistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?"""
Joey:,"b"" Wow, that's, uh, dirty."""
Joey:,"b' Hey, kids...'"
Ross:,"b"" (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not\nsaying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."""
Chandler:,b' (Imitating) But you found me!'
Chandler:,b' Kill me. Kill me now. '
Joey:,b' (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?'
Chandler:,"b"" Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I\ninvited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"""
Chandler:,"b"" I'm sorry you misunderstood..."""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hi, Max!'"
Phoebe:,b' Are you alright?'
Phoebe:,"b"" You're going to Minsk."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here\njust 'cause of me."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and\nthat's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say\nthat?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you\nunderstand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you\nput your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and\nyou'll never forget me."""
Phoebe:,"b"" And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because\nyou don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna\nmiss you. You scientist guy."""
Joey:,"b"" There y'go, kids."""
Chandler:,b' (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.\n(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)'
Joey:,b' You seen Sandy?'
Chandler:,"b"" Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's\nbedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to\ntell you."""
Rachel:,"b' Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.'"
Rachel:,b' The bll is drrbing!'
Chandler:,b' And the moment of joy is upon us.'
Joey:,b' Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.'
Phoebe:,b' Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.'
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,\nbut I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight."""
Rachel:,"b"" I can't kiss anyone."""
Joey:,"b"" Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."""
Ross:,"b"" Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me."""
Chandler:,"b"" Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody\nkiss me!"""
Joey:,b' Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.'
Ross:,"b"" (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I\nmean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning\nit in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you\nback."""
Rachel:,b' ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.'
