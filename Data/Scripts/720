Ross:,b' So that\x92s two of my wives.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh wow. Why don\x92t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a\nManhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.\nMonica just glares at her.) These pins aren\x92t for playing are they?'"
Chandler:,"b' This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Hello!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) '
Rachel:,b' Stop picturing it!!'
Joey:,"b' Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?'"

Chandler:,b' Y\x92know I think we should invite them.'
Chandler:,b' Well this is just sad!'
Rachel:,b' That is not a problem.'
Joey:,b' (leaning down to her) Maybe you\x92ll order a little sangria?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and\nif there\x92s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a\nfew) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, thanks a lot for hookin\x92 me up Rach. I want you to know\nthat I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m Monica\x92s maid of honor. Okay? Don\x92t try to blue pin\nme!'
Chandler:,"b' (sees another rack) Well, what\x92s the deal with these? These-these\nlook nice.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then\nwhen they\x92re done with them they just send \x91em back.'
Chandler:,b' You mean like for award shows?'
Rachel:,b' Some of them.'
Chandler:,"b' You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people\nyelling, ""Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!""'"
Rachel:,"b' Honey, might I suggest watching a little more '"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Umm, well let\x92s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.'"
Chandler:,b' Not bad.'
Rachel:,b' (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O\x92Neil.'
Chandler:,b' Who\x92s that?'
Rachel:,"b' He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, '"

Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Chandler:,b' Are you serious?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,b' 007?! This is James Bond\x92s tux?!'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I have to get married in James Bond\x92s tux!'"
Rachel:,b' It\x92s a pretty cool tux.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, it\x92s not just that, I would be England\x92s most powerful\nweapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty\x92s secret service. A man who fears no\none; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?'"
Joey:,b' We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)'
Phoebe:,b' I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey\x92s like\nin Checkers.) Chess!'
Joey:,b' Nice move.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the\nwedding: do you need one?'"
Joey:,"b' No, I\x92m performing the ceremony. I\x92m not wearing a tux.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, what are you going to wear?'"
Joey:,"b' Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.'"
Rachel:,b' Huh. Does Monica know about this?'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t think so.'
Rachel:,b' Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, y\x92know what? I can\x92t. I have to have dinner with that\nMelissa girl.'"
Joey:,b' (excitedly) Can I come?! I won\x92t even talk! You\x92ll just hear the\nnoise from my video camera.'
Phoebe:,b' What is this? What\x92s going on?'
Joey:,b' Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey\x92s lewd\nversion?'"
Phoebe:,b' Joey\x92s!'
Joey:,b' Okay\x85'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid\nmistake of telling Joey that one time\x85she and I y\x92know\x85kissed a little bit.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (laughs) Yeah, I\x92m sure that happened.'"
Rachel:,b' It-it did!'
Phoebe:,b' Sure!'
Joey:,"b' Hey. (Laughs, then seriously) It happened!'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and\nMelissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! '"
Phoebe:,b' (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the\ncheek.'
Joey:,b' Why are you taking this away from me?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay! I just\x97I didn\x92t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey\nsmiles and nods lewdly.)'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m not saying that I\x92m a lesbian! I\x92m just saying that\nthis happened!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you\x92re so\x97y\x92know\nso\x85vanilla.'"
Rachel:,b' (shocked) Vanilla?!'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m not vanilla! I\x92ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I\ngot-I got drunk and married in Vegas!'
Phoebe:,b' To Ross.'
Rachel:,"b' All right, y\x92know what? If you don\x92t want to believe me about\nthis, why don\x92t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay! All right! Yeah! \x91Cause I just can\x92t picture it.'
Joey:,"b' Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.'"
Ross:,b' Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)'
Chandler:,b' A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?'
Ross:,"b' No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman\x92s\ntux!'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' That\x92s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the\nhit film\x85that Batman film he was in.'
Chandler:,b' You can\x92t wear that! I\x92m wearing the famous tux! James\nBond\x92s tux!'
Ross:,b' So?'
Chandler:,b' So\x97If you wear that you\x92ll make mine less special.'
Ross:,"b' Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have\nthe most special thing of all! '"
Chandler:,"b' Please, don\x92t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!'"
Ross:,"b' Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, it\x92s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I\nwould never do anything to upset you.'"
Ross:,b' When I got married you slept with my sister.'
Chandler:,b' '
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, they\x92re not coming.'"
Joey:,b' Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.\nThey\x85feel a little unwanted.'
Joey:,"b' Look Mon, if you could just call my mom\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Come on! Look just-just tell\x97let her know that you really want them\nto be there. Let\x92s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over\nthe years.'"
Joey:,b' Is it her fault that some of them didn\x92t make it to you?'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know. Just uh, just tell \x91em it was a mix-up with the\ninvitations, or\x97No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh. Oh, that\x92s great!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! Y\x92know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us\ndown when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.'"
Rachel:,"b' (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,\ntellin\x92 Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I\nuh, we made out.'"
Rachel:,"b' Remember?! We\x97come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the\ncoconut bikini tops\x85'"
Rachel:,b' \x85we went back to the house and we got really silly and we\x85we made\nout.'
Phoebe:,b' Really?!'
Chandler:,b' Ross is Batman!'
Chandler:,b' Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman\nis so much cooler than James Bond!'
Chandler:,b' Batman has a utility belt!'
Chandler:,b' Batman has the Batmobile!'
Chandler:,b' Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get '
Chandler:,"b' Actually, I don\x92t like martinis.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want\npeople to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?'"
Joey:,"b' Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it\x92s gonna start a\nlittle late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?'"
Joey:,"b' Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it\x92s the same day as my\nniece\x92s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.\n\x91Cause my part\x92s just in the beginning I\x92m not even in the rest of the\nshow\x97Wedding!'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little\n\x91til they get there?'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Yeah y\x92know, like warm up the crowd. Ask \x91em where\nthey\x92re from. \x91Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister '"
Rachel:,b' How can you not remember us kissing?!'
Rachel:,b' Wh\x85 Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We\ncouldn\x92t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin\x92 together?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, somewhere Joey\x92s head is exploding.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah\x97but come on\x97Listen, I\x92m sorry I don\x92t want to\nmake you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn\x92t believe\nme.'"
Rachel:,b' No!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel, it\x92s okay. You don\x92t have to do this. I believe you.\nAll right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you Phoebe.'
Phoebe:,b' I know.'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. '
Ross:,b' Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don\x92t we put them on? Y\x92know\nget a picture of Batman and James Bond together.'
Chandler:,b' I would but mine doesn\x92t fit. The pants are a little tight.'
Ross:,b' Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes\ntogether.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, does that mean that you\x92re not going to be wearing yours?'"
Ross:,"b' What, are you kidding? It\x92s Batman\x92s tux!!'"
Chandler:,b' (standing up) Let me try it on!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin\x92 in\nthere.'"
Chandler:,b' (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds\nsomething in the pocket) What\x92s this?'
Ross:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' An invitation for the '
Ross:,b' Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!'
Chandler:,b' The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.\n(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)'
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?'"
Joey:,"b' No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,\nthat was really sweet. They\x92re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, you\x92re welcome. And tell them we\x92re really glad\nthey\x92re coming.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!\n(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this\nwhen I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party\ntime.'"
Rachel:,b' It happened! I am telling you it happened!'
Rachel:,"b' What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, '"
Rachel:,b' (shocked) What?'
Rachel:,b' (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!'
Rachel:,b' (moves away again) I-I-I-I\x92m just\x85I\x92m just a good kisser!'

Phoebe:,b' I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.'
Rachel:,b' And?'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92ve had better.'

Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know what they say, the 23'"
Chandler:,b' Whose is it?'
Rachel:,b' Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.'
Chandler:,b' Whose is it?'

Chandler:,"b' Oh, come on! I don\x92t care! Come on! Whose is it?'"
Rachel:,b' Diane Keaton.'
