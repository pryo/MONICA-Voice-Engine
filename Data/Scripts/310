Chandler:,"b' (reading the comics) Eh..., I don\x92t, I don\x92t know.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still\nbe allowed to fly this thing?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?'"
Rachel:,"b' (to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?'"
Chandler:,b' (thinks about it) Yeah?'
Ross:,"b' Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.'"
Chandler:,"b' Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.'"
Ross:,b' Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.'
Chandler:,b' I was shrieking... like a Marine.'
Ross:,"b' All right here. Watch me execute the three \x91P\x92s of championship\nplay. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a\nbackswing and hits Sarah who\x92s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both\nwatch in horror.)'"
Ross:,b' I know. I feel horrible. Okay.'
Chandler:,b' (reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on '
Ross:,"b' Well, I\x92m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do\nyou think she\x92ll like?'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)'
Ross:,"b' All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)'"
Chandler:,"b' Look out kids, he\x92s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his\nhead down in shame.)'"
Joey:,b' And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.'
Phoebe:,"b' Have fun. Oh wait, no, don\x92t! I forgot I am totally against that\nnow.'"
Joey:,b' What? Me having a job?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and\ntheir, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,\nhow do you sleep at night?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I\x92m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,\nPhoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their\nfulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,"b' Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of\nthem, it\x92s the only chance to see New York.'"
Rachel:,"b' Gunther, Gunther, please, I\x92ve worked here for two and a half\nyears, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)'"
Rachel:,"b"" Huh. Well, y'know that\x92s actually a really good idea, because that\nway they\x92ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses\ndo that too."""
Rachel:,"b' Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it\nwas a club they went to. Oh God, I\x92m, I\x92m sorry. (walks away)'"
Ross:,"b' So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that\nyou get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don\x92t have to sell those\ncookies anymore. '"
Ross:,"b' Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?'"
Ross:,b' I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the\nway to India.'
Ross:,"b' Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to\nsell in order to win?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his\nwallet) How much are the boxes?'"
Ross:,b' (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?'
Ross:,"b' Well, that makes sense.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, Sarah, anything.'"
Ross:,"b' Hi, I\x92m selling Brown Bird cookies.'"
Ross:,"b' No, hi, I\x92m, I\x92m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird\nsalute.)'"
Ross:,"b' Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I\x92m not invited to\nsleep-overs.'"
Ross:,"b' No, please, please, um, it\x92s for a poor little girl who wants to go\nto Spacecamp more than anything in the world.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay! I\x92m going. I\x92m going. (goes across the hall to knock\non another door.)'"
Ross:,b' All right!!'
Phoebe:,b' (walking up to Joey) Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Hey. What, what are you doing here?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,\nall right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...'"
Joey:,"b' Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....'"
Phoebe:,b' Destiny.'
Joey:,b' Sure.'
Phoebe:,b' Yes.'
Joey:,b' All right.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (One of Joey\x92s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!\nThat one doesn\x92t look very fulfilled.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, that\x92s, that\x92s ah, one of the old ones, he\x92s just\ntaking it to the back.'"
Phoebe:,"b' You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.'"
Joey:,b' Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.'
Phoebe:,"b' So, what happens to the old guys?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, they go into the chipper.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Why, do I have a feeling that\x92s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey\npoints out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play\nin the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against\nJoey\x92s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)'"
Joey:,b' (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the \x91cut\nit\x92 motion with his hands)'
Ross:,"b' ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,\nSanta, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.'"
Joey:,"b' All right, I\x92ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus\x92s.'"
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I\x92m trying to send a little girl to\nSpacecamp, I\x92m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?'"
Chandler:,"b' Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?'"
Ross:,"b' No, but ah, there\x92s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you\nwhat, I\x92ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.'"
Ross:,b' Mon?'
Ross:,"b' Ah, no Mon, Dad '"
Ross:,"b' Oh, come on, now you know you want \x91em.'"
Ross:,"b' I\x92ll tell you what Mon, I\x92ll give you the first box for free.'"
Ross:,b' Come on! All the cool kids are eating \x91em! (chases after her.)'
Rachel:,"b' (sitting down next to Chandler) I\x92m training to be better at a job\nthat I hate, my life officially sucks.'"
Joey:,"b' Look Rach, wasn\x92t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you\nwanted to do fashion stuff?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, yeah! I\x92m still pursuing that.'"
Chandler:,"b"" How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out\nresumes like what, two years ago?"""
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x92m also sending out.... good thoughts.'"
Joey:,"b' If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you\x92ve got nothing\npushing you to get another one. You need the fear.'"
Rachel:,b' The fear?'
Chandler:,"b' He\x92s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go\nafter a job you really want.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well then how come you\x92re still at a job that you hate, I mean why\ndon\x92t you quit and get \x91the fear\x92?'"
Chandler:,"b' Because, I\x92m too afraid.'"
Rachel:,"b"" I don\x92t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,\ny'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don\x92t want to be 30 and still work here."""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, that\x92d be much worse than being 28, and '"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Can\x92t I just look at the handles on them?'
Rachel:,"b"" Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know\nwhy I\x92m a terrible waitress? Because, I don\x92t care. I don\x92t care. I\ndon\x92t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don\x92t care where the\ntray spot is, I just don\x92t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don\x92t think\nI should do it anymore. I\x92m gonna give you my weeks notice."""
Rachel:,"b' Gunther, I quit.'"
Chandler:,b' (to Joey) Does this mean we\x92re gonna have to start paying for\ncoffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)'
Ross:,"b' ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?'"
Chandler:,b' I spelled out boobies.'
Ross:,"b' Ah, we\x92re out. I sold them all.'"
Ross:,"b' Monica, I\x92m cutting you off.'"
Ross:,"b' Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.'"
Chandler:,"b' So, how many have you sold so far?'"
Ross:,b' Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh my God, how did you do that?'"
Ross:,"b"" Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as \x91Laser\nFloyd\x92 was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!\nThat\x92s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, \x91the munchies.\x92 So I\nah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They\ncall me: 'Cookie Dude!'"""
Rachel:,"b' (entering) Okay, stop what you\x92re doing, I need envelope stuffers,\nI need stamp lickers.....'"
Ross:,"b' Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?'"
Chandler:,b' Me! On my computer.'
Ross:,b' Well you sure used a large font.'
Chandler:,"b' Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad\nco-captain only took up so much room.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey-hey-hey that\x92s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!\nYou wanna know what else is really funny?!'
Chandler:,b' Something else I might have said?'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, I don\x92t know, weren\x92t you the guy that told\nme to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!'"
Ross:,"b' Sweetie, calm down, it\x92s gonna be okay.'"
Rachel:,"b"" No, it\x92s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I\ndon\x92t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I\x92m just gonna, I\x92m just gonna call\nGunther and I\x92m gonna tell him, I\x92m not quitting."""
Chandler:,b' You-you-you don\x92t wanna give into the fear.'
Rachel:,b' You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and\nyour fear.... '
Joey:,"b' (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!'"
Chandler:,"b' Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)'"
Joey:,"b' What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?'"
Rachel:,b' No.'

Joey:,b' Not a problem.'
Rachel:,b' Thanks.'
Joey:,b' And now for the great news.'
Ross:,"b' What, that wasn\x92t the great news?'"
Joey:,"b' Only if you think it\x92s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)\nsnow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind\nof Christmas lookie.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it\x92s a little more\nmoney, but you get a nicer smell.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you\ndon\x92t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead\ntree she has)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay but that\x92s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it\x92s\nChristmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, the ah, trees that don\x92t fulfil their Christmas destiny are\nthrown in the chipper.'"
Joey:,"b' Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one\x92s yours!\nAhhh.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!\nI\x92m sorry, I\x92m sorry, I didn\x92t mean to get so emotional, I guess it\x92s\njust the holidays, it\x92s hard."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I wasn\x92t even thinking about that.'"
Ross:,"b' (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you\nsell?'"
Ross:,"b' Hey now! That was an accident, okay.'"
Ross:,b' What\x92s a scrud?'
Ross:,b' I don\x92t have too. I can just look at you.'

Ross:,b' That\x92s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the\nsalute)'

Ross:,"b' Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....\nnuget.... diffency.'"
Chandler:,"b' Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old\nsister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Rachel, who\x92s entering) Hey! How\x92d the interview go?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I blew it. I wouldn\x92t of even hired me.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you\x92re gonna go on like a thousand\ninterviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That\x92s not how that was supposed\nto come out.'"
Phoebe:,b' This is the worst Christmas ever.'
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the\ncoffee house."""

Ross:,b' That word was swans.'
Chandler:,"b' Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my\nChristmas.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Oh my God!'

Ross:,"b' I\x92m, I\x92m sorry you didn\x92t get to go to Spacecamp, and\nI\x92m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah\nTuttle\x92s Private Very Special Spacecamp!!

Ross:,b' Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by\nfor mission countdown!'
Joey:,b' (simulating an echo) '
Chandler:,b' I\x92m an alien. I\x92m an alien.'
Ross:,b' Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey\x92s\nhead.)'
