Chandler:,"b' Wait a minute, wait. You\x92re telling me this actress person is the\nonly woman you ever wanted who didn\x92t want you back?!'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it\x92s like to be you?'
Joey:,"b' Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we\x92re on stage I get to-to kiss\nher and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it\x92s like\nsomebody\x92s ripping out my heart!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s so '"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.'"
Ross:,b' We were all pretty shaken up about it.'
Phoebe:,"b' Wait, am I missing something though? \x91Cause I thought death was\nsomething that\x92s supposed to be sad, in a way.'"
Ross:,"b' Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.'"
Ross:,b' You get the dollhouse.'
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, just a barrel.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really?! Really?!'
Chandler:,b' My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, Sophie!'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b"" Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn\x92t have to walk me all\nthe way back up here."""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, that\x92s-that\x92s okay, no problem. (He starts to look\naround her office.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don\x92t keep the women\x92s\nlingerie here in the office?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I realise that.'"
Rachel:,b' Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)'
Rachel:,"b' (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)\nJoanna.'"
Chandler:,"b' Thanks, it\x92s ah, Gaelic, for \x91Thy turkey\x92s done.\x92\nSo ah, I\x92m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.'"
Rachel:,"b' Bye, Chandler.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, nothing, he\x92s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice\nit anymore.'"
Rachel:,"b' No!! No! He\x92s not married, or involved, with anyone!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x92ll ask him for you, if you want me too?'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hello.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It\x92s so beautiful.'
Phoebe:,"b' So, I\x92m here, ready to play.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She\nremoves this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the\nhouse.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s a dog, every house should have a dog.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, maybe it\x92s so big because the house was built on radioactive\nwaste.'"
Chandler:,b' (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, no, that\x92s the ghost for the attic.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you\x92ve got one, because the house\nis sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.'"
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient\nIndian burial ground? That would never happen.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, obviously you don\x92t know much about the U.S. government.'"
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' I need to talk to you!'
Ross:,"b' Sure, what\x92s up?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.'"
Ross:,b' I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."""
Rachel:,"b' Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about\nyou...'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin\x92\nout the Chan-Chan man!'"
Rachel:,"b' (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you\ninterested at all?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I\x92ll do it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she\x92s gonna love me.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the\nhouse!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)\nRoof! Rrroof-roof-roof!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we\x92re not\nwelcome in the house of no imagination.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, Pheebs, while we\x92re hovering around the subject. I just have to\nsay dinosaurs, they-they don\x92t go, rrroof!'"
Phoebe:,b' The little ones do.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, Kate!'"
Joey:,"b' Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last\nweek...'"
Joey:,"b' (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was\ngood, yeah...'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.'"
Joey:,"b' (looks at her, shocked) What?!'"
Joey:,"b' Get out of here, really?!'"
Joey:,b' Yeah? '
Joey:,b' They gave me the shaft all right.'
Joey:,"b' Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a\ndrink sounds great.'"
Joey:,b' All right.'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! '
Phoebe:,"b' Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!'"
Rachel:,b' Wow!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing\nthe interior.)'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, what\x92s this?!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay, it\x92s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides\na doll down the slide)'"
Rachel:,b' What\x92s this?'
Phoebe:,"b' The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come\nover, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.'"
Ross:,b' This is the coolest house ever!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some\nincense)'"
Rachel:,b' All right!'
Ross:,b' I would!'
Ross and Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the\nhouse.)'"
Ross and Rachel:,b' Ooohhhh!!'
Phoebe:,"b' And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)'"
Ross and Rachel:,b' Ahhhh!!'
Chandler:,"b' (entering) Hey, my Father\x92s house does that!'"
Rachel:,"b' (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there\x92s nothing\nlike a cool, crisp New York evening. '"
Rachel:,b' Hmm.'
Chandler:,"b' Of course, I didn\x92t get to enjoy any of that, because\nJoanna\x92s such a '"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I....'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I know...'"
Joey:,"b' Come on baby, don\x92t go. Please? What do you say?'"
Joey:,b' (to Kate) That guy\x92s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?'
Joey:,"b' Hey, I\x92m not interested in her sweater! It\x92s what\x92s\nunderneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who\nI\x92m going out with?'"
Joey:,b' Do you want me to want you to care?'
Joey:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Come on baby, don\x92t go. Please? What do you say?'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, it\x92s gonna be all right.'"
Joey:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b"" Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,\ny'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."""
Joey:,b' Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)'
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know.'
Joey:,b' How do you mean?'
Joey:,b' Maybe he could slip her the tongue.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his\nwaist.'"
Joey:,"b' And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,\nand, and bite her!'"
Joey:,b' Something like that?'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' (to Ross) Hey.'
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,b' (to Monica) Hey. '
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' It\x92s a little early to be drinkin\x92.'
Joey:,"b' No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.'"
Ross:,b' Ohhhhh!'
Joey:,"b' Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...'"
Joey:,"b' Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in\nand breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming \x91cause, \x91cause her eyes keep\ngoing like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he\x92s been\nprocessed by the devil, or something.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering with Rachel) I\x92m telling ya, Joanna\x92s got it all\nwrong. Okay? All I said was, \x91This was fun. Let\x92s do it again sometime.\nI\x92ll give you a call.\x92'"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you\x92re going to call her?'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s what you say at the end of a date.'
Rachel:,"b' You can\x92t just say, \x91Nice to meet you, good night?\x92'"
Chandler:,"b"" To her face? Look it\x92s the end of the date, I\x92m standing\nthere, I know all she\x92s waiting for is for me to say \x91I\x92ll call her\x92\nand it\x92s just y'know, comes out. I can\x92t help it, it\x92s a compulsion."""
Rachel:,"b' Well, they always called.'"
Rachel:,b' No. Sorry.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you\nare my boss.'"
Rachel:,b' Well...'
Rachel:,b' No. I...'
Rachel:,b' (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!'
Chandler:,"b' Multiple, so many paper cuts.'"
Rachel:,"b' Why hasn\x92t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don\x92t understand.\nWhy? He said he\x92ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I\x92m telling you she has flipped out,\nshe\x92s gone crazy!'"
Chandler:,"b' (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on, this isn\x92t funny. She thinks it\x92s my fault that you\nhaven\x92t called her. You have to call her!'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, you can\x92t call somebody after this long just to say,\n\x91In case you didn\x92t notice, I don\x92t like you!\x92'"
Rachel:,b' Well then you\x92re going to have to take her out again.'
Chandler:,b' Nooo!! She\x92s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop\nthing in the corner of her eye!'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t care! I don\x92t care! You are going to have to take her\nout again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it\x92s actually ended. And, I\ndon\x92t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!'"
Chandler:,"b' All right! Fine! But it\x92s just a lunch date, no more than an\nhour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don\x92t want you setting me up with anybody\never again!'"
Rachel:,b' That\x92s fine!'
Chandler:,"b"" That\x92s just a lot of big talk, y'know."""
Rachel:,b' I know.'
Ross:,b' Mon?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, fire! There, there\x92s a fire! Fire!!'"
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,"b' So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you\nah, did you talk to Marshall?'"
Joey:,"b"" Y'know, about what happened with us."""
Joey:,"b' What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you\ncan\x92t tell me last night didn\x92t mean something to you. I-I was there,\nyou\x92re not that good an actress.'"
Joey:,b' Nooo.'
Joey:,"b' Hi, Lauren.'"
Ross:,"b' Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What\nhappened?!'
Ross:,"b' Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the\npoint of origin.) In the Aroma Room.'"
Phoebe:,b' All right. Did everyone get out okay?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to\nremove it.)'"
Ross:,"b' No Phoebe, don\x92t look! You don\x92t want to see what\x92s under\nthere!!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the\nFoster puppets! '"
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s not a big deal. It\x92s, just it\x92s right here,\n(points to his eye) and it\x92s all the time.'"
Chandler:,"b' (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was\npleasant.'"
Chandler:,"b' The food there was, was great.'"
Chandler:,b' So take care.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, this was great. I\x92ll give you a call. We should do it again\nsometime. (Rachel is disappointed) '"
Rachel:,b' Sophie\x92s desk.'
Rachel:,b' (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!'
Chandler:,b' Noo! '
Rachel:,b' Chandler!!'
Chandler:,"b' Look, I\x92m sorry. Okay? I\x92m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you are going to tell her and you\x92re going to tell her now.\n(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)'"
Chandler:,b' Ahhhh\x97I\x92m not going to call you.'
Chandler:,"b"" I\x92m sorry. I\x92m-I\x92m-I\x92m sorry that I said I was\ngoing to when I\x92m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this\nisn\x92t Rachel\x92s fault. It\x92s me. I have serious, serious problems when it\ncomes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And\nI\x92m really sorry, it\x92s just that this is not, this isn\x92t going to work out."""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, o-okay.'"
Chandler:,b' Well this is great! I\x92ll give you a call! We should do it again\nsometime!'
Joey:,"b' (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I\x92m saying is I should\x92ve\nconsidered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I\x92ve ah, I\x92ve\nrecently learned what\x92s it like to be on your side of it, and I\x92m sorry. So, do\nyou think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and\ncrosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.\nLoreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she\x92s not home huh? (listens) Well ah,\nactually I kinda need to talk to you too.'"
