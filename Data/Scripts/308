Rachel:,b' Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? '
Chandler:,b' I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, I\x92m not gonna have one.'"
Ross:,b' Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)'

Chandler:,"b' All right I\x92ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)'"
Ross:,"b' So what\x92s a matter, you need a dentist? I\x92ve got a good one.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can\x92t see him.'"
Chandler:,b' See that is the problem with invisible dentists.'
Ross:,b' Why? Why can\x92t you go to him?'
Phoebe:,"b' Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.'"
Chandler:,"b' That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down\nthe hygienist\x92s blouse.'"
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,\nmy mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend \x91Albino Bob\x92.'"
Rachel:,b' And all these people actually died?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yes, while I was in the chair! That\x92s why I take such good care of\nmy teeth now, y'know, it\x92s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"""
Ross:,"b' Pheebs, come on, you didn\x92t kill anybody, these people just happened\nto die when you went to the dentist. It\x92s, it\x92s, it\x92s just ah, a\ncoincidence.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well tell that to them. Oh! You can\x92t, their dead.'"
Ross:,"b' Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up\nand kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?'"
Phoebe:,b' (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)'
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, fine, fine, but if you\x92re my next victim, don\x92t\ncome back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.'"
Rachel:,b' I promise.'
Phoebe:,"b' Although, don\x92t feel like you can\x92t visit.'"
Joey:,"b' (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?'"
Ross:,"b' (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he\x92s\nnot.'"
Ross:,"b' What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going\nto tell Chandler?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to\nnot.'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, you can\x92t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you\nhave to tell him.'"
Joey:,"b' It\x92ll kill him. I mean it\x92ll, it\x92ll just kill him.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, you could wait \x91til I go to the dentist, maybe '"
Joey:,b' (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.\nIt\x92s like a '
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I\x92m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the\nlook out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,\nor... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all\nthat um...... (starts to cry and runs out)'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids\nmessed up the Homo Sapien display.'"
Joey:,b' What did they do?'
Ross:,"b' Well, they painted over the word \x91Sapien\x92 for one thing, then\nthey rearranged the figures, let\x92s just leave it at that.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, that\x92s what I was going to ask, thank you.'"
Rachel:,b' Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?'
Ross:,"b' You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths\n\x91Don\x92t worry, I\x92ll be here the whole time.\x92 to Ross.) Yes! That\x92d\nbe great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica\nsarcastically mouths \x91Yeah!\x92 and holds up her thumb.)'"
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey, Ross?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' I\x92ve got a science question.'
Ross:,b' Hmm?'
Joey:,"b' If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact \x91Homo-sapien\x92, is that why\nthere extinct?'"
Ross:,"b' Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey, I\x92m not judging.'"
Rachel:,"b"" (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come\non! All right, y'know what I think he\x92s bored."""

Joey:,b' You said number two.'
Rachel:,b' I also said number one.'
Joey:,b' I know. (giggles harder)'
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey! Everyone.'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,b' How\x92s my little boy?'
Rachel:,"b' He\x92s perfect, he\x92s never been better.'"
Ross:,"b' (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What\x92d you do, take him whaling?'"

Joey:,b' Uh.'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Joey:,b' Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting\nstronger too, to bring down something that big.'"
Rachel:,b' Well maybe he\x92s just taking a nap.'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m tellin\x92 ya, he hasn\x92t moved since this morning.'"
Ross:,b' And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn\x92t\nmoving.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, we have gotta find out if he\x92s alive.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, there is one way. His window\x92s open, I say, we poke him.'"

Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Well, now we got a reason.'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Well, we\x92re fashioning a very long poking device.'"
Chandler:,b' All right.'
Joey:,"b' Hey uh, what\x92s a matter?'"
Chandler:,b' I talked to Janice.'
Joey:,"b' Oh my God, is she going back to him?'"
Chandler:,"b"" She doesn\x92t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this\nmorning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that\ntwelve pack of condoms. And now I can\x92t even return them, because she choked on the\nreciept!"""
Joey:,"b' What are you ah, what are you gonna do?'"
Chandler:,"b"" I don\x92t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"""
Joey:,"b' Well, it doesn\x92t matter what I would do.'"
Chandler:,"b' Come on, tell me.'"
Joey:,"b' All right, you\x92re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it\nwas me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I\nwould bow out.'"
Chandler:,"b' What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey\nquickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?'"
Joey:,"b"" They have a kid together, y'know. They\x92re like, they\x92re like a\nfamily, and if, I don\x92t know, there\x92s chance they could make that work, I know I\nwouldn\x92t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna\nah, come poke a nude guy?"""
Ross:,"b' Well, he\x92s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?'"
Rachel:,"b' Are you, are you, are you sure it\x92s ah, a new bump? I mean, no\noffense, I\x92ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.'"
Ross:,"b"" It\x92s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,\ny'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."""
Rachel:,b' (confidently) I did!'
Ross:,b' I know! I\x92m saying you have to watch them all the time.'
Rachel:,b' I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against\nthat thing!'
Ross:,b' Monica did it?'
Ross:,b' Monica?'
Ross:,"b' Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?'"
Ross:,"b"" Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet\nsong, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he\x92s leaving out \x91e\x92\nand \x91f.\x92 It\x92s like they just ah, I don\x92t know, fell out of his head."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, and also, he\x92s, he\x92s walkin\x92 kind of funny, his left\nleg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he\x92s in there just sort of\ny'know... (walks around in a circle) """
Rachel:,b' I hope it\x92s still funny when you\x92re in hell.'
Ross:,b' Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!'
Rachel:,b' I\x92ll get the hat.'
Chandler:,"b' Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me\nget through it, because it\x92s, it\x92s, it\x92s not gonna be easy.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I think you should go back with Gary. I don\x92t wanna be the guy\nthat breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.\nWhenever I would see him I was always think y'know \x91You\x92re the reason, you are\nthe reason why their not together.\x92 and I hated that guy. And it didn\x92t matter\nhow nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, well. It\x92s the right thing to do.'"
Chandler:,b' Then don\x92t leave me!'
Chandler:,"b' Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!'"
Chandler:,"b' No you don\x92t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce\nanother chance.'"
Chandler:,b' Ohhh. Don\x92t go.'
Chandler:,b' No. No! No! No!'
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I\ndon\x92t care!!'
Chandler:,b' You can\x92t leave! I have your shoe!'
Joey:,"b' All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be\ndifficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.'"
Ross:,"b' Can we please focus here, a naked man\x92s life hangs in the balance!'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m telling you he\x92s dead. What we are about to have here is a\ndead fat guy on a stick.'
Joey:,"b' All right, ladies and gentlemen, let\x92s poke. (they start to advance\nthe giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.\nOkay, okay, we\x92re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their\nview of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the\nneedle. '"
Phoebe:,b' He\x92s alive! He\x92s a-live!!!'
