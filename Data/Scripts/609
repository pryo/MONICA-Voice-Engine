Chandler:,b' Sydney Portier? Hehheh.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh! That\x92s great, they haven\x92t seen the place since I moved\nin!'"
Chandler:,b' (shocked at the news) Why can\x92t I tell them that we live\ntogether?'
Chandler:,b' Why haven\x92t you told them?!'
Chandler:,b' Why haven\x92t you told them?! Wouldn\x92t they be happy?!'
Chandler:,b' Why wouldn\x92t they be happy?'
Chandler:,b' What? What? Why?!'
Chandler:,b' Is this why they don\x92t like me or why you don\x92t like me?'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know, it\x92ll be okay. It\x92ll be okay. Because when they\ncome over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then\nwe\x92ll tell \x91em.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn\x92t I?'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You\x92re parents like me,\nright?'"
Ross:,"b' (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!'"
Chandler:,b' Well Monica just told me that they don\x92t.'
Ross:,"b' (not paying attention) Yeah, they don\x92t like you.'"
Chandler:,b' (annoyed) Do you know why?'
Ross:,"b' I dunno, maybe it\x92s because you\x92re really sarcastic. Or maybe\nit\x92s cause you uh-'"
Chandler:,b' (angry) Well if people don\x92t know they shouldn\x92t just guess!'
Chandler:,"b' This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.'"
Joey:,"b' Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin\x92 up, eh?'"
Chandler:,b' Maybe I could give thanks by taking my '
Joey:,b' Well maybe I love ya\x92.'
Chandler:,b' [mocks that last comment].'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Yeah, why? What\x92s up?'"
Ross:,b' For real?'
Joey:,"b' Ye-ye, we go to yours!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it\x92s my\nsister. But, uh, uh y\x92know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it\nreally helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.'"
Joey:,"b' How you got three women to marry you, I\x92ll never know.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to\nmake a traditional English truffle!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case\nRachel\x92s dessert is...[about to say \x93bad\x94] so good that I eat all of it.\nThere\x92s none left for anybody else!'"
Rachel:,"b' So, if-if I mess this up, there\x92s nothing else for dessert?'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you.\nTechnical question, how do you know when uh, the butter\x92s done?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!'"
Ross:,b' And the place looks so nice!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!'"
Ross:,b' Happy Thanksgiving!'
Joey:,"b' Well, this has been great!'"
Ross:,b' See ya!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, oh, we did say we\x92d stop by this little thing Joey\x92s\nroommate is having.'"
Ross:,"b' Some would say she\x92s attractive, yes.'"
Phoebe:,b' And who else is going to be there?'
Joey:,"b' Uh, some of her friends, yeah.'"
Rachel:,b' Her dancer friends?'
Joey:,"b' (frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be\nthere and they\x92re gonna be, be drinkin\x92 and dancin, and we really wanna go!'"
Ross:,"b' (to Joey) Dude, we were good!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very\nThanksgivingy.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, but-but it is, uh, it\x92s just like the first Thanksgiving, when\nthe Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in\nthe new world!'"
Chandler:,"b' Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear,\nlet us take off your coats!'"
Chandler:,"b' Whoa, snowing out there?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last\nnight.'"
Rachel:,b' Really?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so\nbrave and so strong! And it\x92s making me look at him totally differently. Y\x92know,\nI mean he used to be just, y\x92know \x93Jack Geller Monica and Ross\x92s dad\x94\nand now he\x92s he\x92s \x93Jack Geller, dream hunk.""'"
Rachel:,"b' I dunno. Y\x92know to me he\x92ll always be \x93Jack Geller, walks\nin while you\x92re changing.\x94'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y\x92know I\x92ve always felt that\nhow a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.'"
Chandler:,b' (worried) He\x92s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.'
Joey:,"b' Rach, you\x92re killin\x92 us here, will ya serve the dessert already?\nThose drunken dancers are waiting! '"
Rachel:,"b' (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn\x92t it beautiful?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, yeah, what is it?'"
Rachel:,"b' It\x92s a truffle. It\x92s got all of these layers. First\nthere\x92s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from\nscratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then\nbeef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something\x92s wrong.] then\na little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!'"
Ross:,b' W-What was the one right before bananas?'
Rachel:,"b' The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y\x92know, I\nthought \x93well, there\x92s mincemeat pie,\x94 I mean that\x92s an English\ndessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y\x92know. [To Joey]\nOh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?'"
Joey:,b' Y-sure!'
Ross:,"b' Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!'"
Joey:,"b' I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!'"
Joey:,b' (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!'
Ross:,"b' Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd\x92s\nPie!'"
Joey:,b' (sad) Oh man! Now she\x92s gonna start all over! We\x92re never gonna\nget to introduce the hot girls to the new world!'
Ross:,"b' No, no, we will. We just won\x92t tell her she messed up.'"
Joey:,b' Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, it\x92ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!'"
Joey:,b' (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are\nfunny...'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!'"
Joey:,b' Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?'
Rachel:,b' No!'
Phoebe:,b' Rachel?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn\x92t\ngive to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yes. Well it\x92s very beautiful. It\x92s cream-colored and\ntight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked.\nJudy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don\x92t mean tight, I mean it\x92s\nnot too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his\nhands.]'"
Chandler:,b' (shocked) What?'
Ross:,"b' (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I think I might know why my parents don\x92t like you.'"
Chandler:,b' You do? Why?'
Ross:,"b' Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got\nhigh in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had\ngotten stoned and jumped out the window.'"
Chandler:,b' What?! Why did you do that?'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know, aheh, your\x92s was the first name that-that popped\ninto my head, I\x92m I\x92m sorry. I-I didn\x92t think it would matter.'"
Chandler:,b' How could it not matter?!'
Ross:,"b' How was I supposed to know we\x92d end up being friends after college,\nlet alone you-you would be living with my sister?'"
Chandler:,b' What about all that \x93friends forever\x94 stuff?'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know, I-I was all high. '"
Chandler:,b' Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on\nme!'
Chandler:,"b' The reason we haven\x92t told them we\x92re together is because\nthey hate me, okay? So will you fix this?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay, I\x92ll tell \x91em it wasn\x92t Chandler who got high.\nNow who should I say it was?'"
Ross:,"b' Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?'"
Phoebe:,b' '
Joey:,b' (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you\nthat all of Janine\x92s friends are dancers?! And that they\x92re going to be drinking\nalot!?'
Rachel:,"b' (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it\x92s so\nromantic.'"
Joey:,b' Well you\x92re whippin\x92 so slow! Can\x92t you do it any faster?'
Rachel:,"b"" Joey! Come on! I don\x92t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is\nthe only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like \x93Oh, remember that\nThanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?\x94"""
Rachel:,"b' So why don\x92t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you\njust worry about eating it, alright?'"
Joey:,b' Oh I am!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, fine!'"
Joey:,b' Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No\nit can\x92t? Okay.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.'"
Ross:,"b' What?! What is with everybody? It\x92s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!'"
Joey:,"b' Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they\x92re all\ngonna\x92 make fun of her, do you want that?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay, we\x92ll just get everyone to act like they like it.\nThat-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!\n(Referring to the dancers.)'"
Joey:,"b' (scolding) Dude, they\x92re not objects.'"
Joey:,"b' Just kiddin,\x92 I\x92ll talk to them, you distract Rach.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay...'
Rachel:,"b' What\x92s up, Ross?'"
Ross:,"b' So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm? '"
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' And um...You look nice today.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no. No Ross, don\x92t do this.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' I just- I don\x92t think us getting back together is a good idea.'
Ross:,b' (shocked) Eh?'
Rachel:,"b' I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be\nrough. Y\x92know? And it\x92s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.'"
Ross:,b' (cutting her off) You\x92re alone.'
Rachel:,"b' No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you\x92re [pity-tone] '"
Ross:,"b' (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can\x92t blame a\nguy for trying!'"
Joey:,"b' Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to\nindicate to Ross that he\x92s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if\nanyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh,\nrubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying \x93mmm\x94 and uh, oh oh!\nAnd smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.'"
Joey:,"b' Rachel, there you are! Come on, let\x92s serve that dessert already!'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, you\x92re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You\ndon\x92t get any dessert.'"
Joey:,b' (happily) Really?'
Rachel:,"b' No, I\x92m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody,\nit\x92s trifle time!'"
Phoebe:,"b' So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn\x92t it?'"
Rachel:,b' It sure is.'
Phoebe:,b' Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?'
Rachel:,b' Beef.'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t have any. You know I don\x92t eat meat. (Faking\ndissapointment.) Ohhh no.'
Rachel:,"b' Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a\nbite with all the layers!'"
Rachel:,"b' Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.'"
Rachel:,b' Well?'
Rachel:,b' Really? How good? '
Chandler:,"b' (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that\nI\x92m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my\ndessert.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me\ntry it.'"
Ross:,b' Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He\nlooks like he\x92s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has\nsome left.'
Ross:,b' It tastes like feet!'
Joey:,b' I like it.'
Ross:,b' Are you kidding?'
Joey:,b' What\x92s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.'
Rachel:,"b' ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and,\nand then just dropped it on the street?'"
Chandler:,"b' (lying) Yes, but if it\x92s any consolation, before the bird dropped\nit, he seemed to enjoy it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on\nthe lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had\nanother dream about Jack.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I dunno, let\x92s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get\nmarried, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night\nclub, and I saw him making out with a girl.'"
Rachel:,"b' (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying\nme! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse,\nwho, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Five minutes ago, a line like that would\x92ve floored me. Now\nnothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a\nletter.'"
Ross:,b' Wha-what?'
Ross:,"b' (in a 5 year old\x92s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom,\nDad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?'"
Ross:,b' Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.\nI\x92m sorry.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn\x92t break the porch swing, Monica\ndid!'"
Ross:,b' Monica and Chandler are living together!'
Phoebe:,b' (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!'
Rachel:,"b' (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I\nwasn\x92t supposed to put beef in the trifle!'"
Joey:,b' (pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!'
Ross:,"b' I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!'"
Chandler:,b' Thank you!'
Chandler:,b' (In a parent-like tone) I\x92ll talk to them! '
Rachel:,"b' You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that\nyou ate that so that I wouldn\x92t feel bad!'"
Joey:,"b' No it isn\x92t, I ate that.'"
Joey:,"b' Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too. '"
