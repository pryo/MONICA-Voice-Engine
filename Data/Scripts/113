Rachel:,b' That is '
Chandler:,"b"" I'm sorry!"""
Rachel:,"b"" You have no respect for anybody's privacy!"""
Chandler:,"b' Rachel, wait, wait.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, you wait! This is ridiculous!'"
Chandler:,b' Can I just say one thing?'
Rachel:,b' What? What?!'
Chandler:,"b"" That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular\nareas."""
Rachel:,b' Oh!!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks\nthings are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."""
Phoebe:,b' Oops!'
Phoebe:,"b' Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Isn't he great?"""
Rachel:,"b"" He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much."""
Phoebe:,"b"" I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's\nnot too shrinky, y'know?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know?\nVinyl."""
Rachel:,"b' Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)'"
Rachel:,"b"" No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"""
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b"" No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."""
Ross:,b' You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?'
Chandler:,b' It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope\nand a box of donuts.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."""
Rachel:,"b' Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice\nboobies."""
Rachel:,"b"" Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."""
Chandler:,"b' Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"""
Chandler:,b' Huh.'
Chandler:,"b' Uhhuh, how did you know that?'"
Joey:,"b' Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, this is my friend Roger.'"
Joey:,"b' Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)'"
Joey:,"b"" (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.\nBazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?"""
Joey:,b' Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)'
Joey:,b' Since then?!'
Joey:,"b"" ...I d'know."""
Joey:,"b"" You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)"""
Joey:,"b"" Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma."""
Joey:,"b"" It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this\ndouble life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be\ncool.... This blows!"""
Rachel:,"b"" I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over\nnear Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become\npeople? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"""
Chandler:,b' (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?'
Rachel:,b' Did you not get a good enough look the other day?'
Ross:,"b"" Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve\nthis. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."""
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I don't see that happening?"""
Rachel:,"b"" C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."""
Chandler:,"b"" Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'"""
Phoebe:,"b"" (Intercom) It's Phoebe."""
Chandler:,"b' (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.'"
Joey:,"b"" What's the matter with Rog?"""
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."""
Ross:,"b"" What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,\nhe's not that bad."""
Ross:,"b"" Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on\nany level thatthat she was a lesbian?"""
Ross:,b' Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?'
Ross:,"b"" That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Isn't he good?"""
Ross:,"b"" Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."""
Ross:,"b' Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!'"
Rachel:,"b"" You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it\nwas the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little\nlifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.'"
Joey:,"b' Night, you guys.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."""
Joey:,"b' Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?'"
Joey:,"b"" I'm Joey Tribbiani."""
Chandler:,"b"" Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"""
Chandler:,"b' Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.'"
Joey:,"b"" Dad, Ronni's here."""
Chandler:,"b"" So, who's up for a big game of """
Joey:,b' Who-ah-ho.'
Joey:,"b"" No you won't."""
Joey:,"b"" If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where\nI can keep an eye on you."""
Joey:,"b"" That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're\nunder my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your\ngirlfriend."""
Joey:,"b"" Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."""
Chandler:,"b' C\'mon, I\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\'s not\nfollowed by ""No thanks, it\'s late."" '"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a\nchange. This has gone on long enough.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, either you break it off with Ronni'"
Joey:,b' Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!'
Joey:,"b"" I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"""
Joey:,"b"" Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. """
Chandler:,"b"" Well, you're gonna."""
Joey:,"b"" I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of\ngirls..."""
Chandler:,"b' Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?'"
Joey:,"b"" Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.\nAnd I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and\ngo the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."""
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go\ninto your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"""
Joey:,b' No.'
Chandler:,"b' No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that\nwasn\'t easy, but you did it! And I\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes\nalong, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I\'m married.""'"
Joey:,b' You really think so?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah. I really do.'
Joey:,"b' Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)'"
Chandler:,b' Get off!'
Rachel:,"b"" Hi, I'm Rachel."""
Rachel:,"b"" Bathroom's up there."""
Rachel:,"b"" Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the\nshower?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey\nand Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib. """
Rachel:,"b"" Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing."""
Joey:,"b"" (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!"""
Rachel:,b' I thought it was Chandler!'
Chandler:,b' (Comes out of his room) What? What?'
Rachel:,b' You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!'
Chandler:,"b' Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey. '
Phoebe:,"b"" Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite\nyou guys."""
Phoebe:,"b"" So what's going on?"""
Ross:,"b"" I dunno, there's just something about..."""
Chandler:,"b"" Basically we just feel that he's..."""
Rachel:,b' We hate that guy.'
Ross:,"b"" We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's\nso perceptive that it freaks you out?"""
Rachel:,"b"" We're sorry."""
Joey:,"b"" Ma! What're you doing here?"""
Joey:,b' Oww! Big ring!'
Joey:,"b' Hold on, you-you knew?'"
Joey:,"b' So then how could you I mean, how could you?!'"
Joey:,"b"" Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking\nabout?! I mean, what about you?"""
Joey:,"b"" I'm...happy...for you?"""
Joey:,"b"" Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is."""
Joey:,b' With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.'
Phoebe:,"b' Nothing, nothing.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a\nliking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."""
Phoebe:,"b"" But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all\nthe good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little..."""
Phoebe:,b' Intense and creepy. '
Phoebe:,"b"" But I don't. Me, Phoebe."""
Phoebe:,"b"" You're not? See, that's why you're so great! """
Joey:,"b"" Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep\npretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her\nhusband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with\nanything except that I found out today."""
Rachel:,b' Wow.'
Chandler:,b' Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.'
Ross:,"b' So Joey, you okay?'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.\nEven if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."""
Rachel:,"b' Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.'"
Chandler:,"b"" If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing\nafter twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."""
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, right.'"
Rachel:,b' What happened?'
Phoebe:,"b"" I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,\nand in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey, Joey. What's going on?"""
Joey:,"b' Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.\n(He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica\nin a towel)'"
Joey:,b' Sorry. Wrong boobies.'
