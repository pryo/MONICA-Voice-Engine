Phoebe:,b' But why does it even matter?!'

Phoebe:,"b' (gasps) You wouldn\x92t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to\ndo this, but I-I\x92ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you\x92ve\ndone it at least twice!'"

Chandler:,b' That\x92s sweet.'
Chandler:,"b' So uh, what did this woman look like?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing\ncalled a mirror?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not\nattractive\x85 (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He\ngets up and grabs a photo album.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, let\x92s see\x85 (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is\nthat her? (Pointing to the picture.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.'"

Rachel:,b' Phoebe is gonna be Monica\x92s maid of honor!'
Joey:,"b' Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that\ngirl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)'"
Rachel:,b' (shocked) '

Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?'"

Joey:,b' Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!'
Ross:,b' I\x92ve had better.'
Joey:,b' Okay! When?!'
Ross:,b' All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!'
Joey:,b' Uh-huh!'
Ross:,b' I\x92ve said it! Okay?! But it\x92s over Joey!'
Joey:,b' I want to do it again.'
Ross:,b' We '
Joey:,b' Why not?'
Ross:,b' Because it\x92s weird!'
Joey:,b' Fine! Do you want something to drink?'
Ross:,"b' Sure, what do you got?'"
Joey:,b' Warm milk and '
Chandler:,b' Can you figure out what I\x92m doing?'
Chandler:,b' Who?'
Chandler:,b' Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the\nbathroom?!'
Chandler:,b' What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better\nperson and that is '"
Joey:,"b' Okay, all right, this is how it\x92s going to work. We\x92re gonna\ngive you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to\n10, 1 being the highest.'"
Ross:,"b' No, 10 is the highest.'"
Joey:,b' Why is 10 the highest?'
Ross:,"b' Because it\x92s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel\nyou\x92re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You\x92re with\nMonica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the\npart of Monica.)'"
Joey:,b' (crying) I don\x92t want to marry Chandler!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, uh\x85'"
Joey:,b' I\x92ve got cold feet.'
Rachel:,b' \x85it\x92s gonna be okay!'
Joey:,"b' No, one man for the rest of my life? I don\x92t know if I can do it!\nThis means I\x92ll never get to sleep with Joey!'"
Rachel:,"b' Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y\x92know,\nit\x92s-it\x92s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember\nthat you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don\x92t get to keep the\ngifts.'"
Joey:,"b' (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I\nlike that!'"
Rachel:,b' Thanks!'
Ross:,"b' Yes, very nice Rachel.'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you judges.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ugh, what a kiss ass.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Joey:,"b' Okay, Phoebe\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes! Your honor?'
Joey:,"b' We\x92re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do""\nwhen her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!'"
Ross:,"b' (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember\nthat\x97(Phoebe screams and tackles him)\x97Ooh!! Ow! Very good!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh!'
Joey:,b' Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!'
Rachel:,b' Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! Do you want, do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!'"
Ross:,b' It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, wait a minute, we haven\x92t pre\x85'"
Ross:,b' Go!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay! Okay! Umm, '"
Rachel:,"b' Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I\x92ve known them separately and\nI\x92ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are\ntruly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds\nit up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon\ntogether. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.'"
Joey:,b' Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, it really was!'"
Rachel:,"b' Aw, thanks!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay Phoebe, I guess you\x92re next (To Joey) although I really\ndon\x92t see the point.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I can\x92t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.\nI remember talking about this today with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.\n(Raises her glass and drinks.)'"
Joey:,b' And she\x92s back in the game.'
Chandler:,"b' (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember\nme.'"
Chandler:,"b' (To Monica) It\x92s a nickname, I\x92ll explain later.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken\nup with you because you were overweight.'"
Chandler:,"b' You-you-you didn\x92t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I\nguess my work here is done!'"
Joey:,"b' All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed\nvery well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that\nin this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel\x97Damnit!'"
Phoebe:,b' Really?! I won!'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I\x92ve heard that\nbefore.)'"
Ross:,"b' Actually, it wasn\x92t that close.'"
Rachel:,"b' No! Y\x92know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was\nridiculous\x97We\x92re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the\ncoin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)'"
Phoebe:,b' The coins have finally forgiven me!'
Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw\nher\nher vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (running after her) Rach, it\x92s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)\nYou guys are the best!'"
Joey:,"b' Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on\nmy couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.) '"
Ross:,b' Why-why would I care about that?'
Joey:,"b' No reason, I\x92m just saying that uh\x85 That\x92s where I\x92ll\nbe. '"
Chandler:,"b' As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I\x92m\ngoing to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.'"
Chandler:,b' I would really love it if I could do both.'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,b' A hundred and forty-five pounds.'
Chandler:,"b' Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I\nwas 15!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.'"
Chandler:,b' You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!'
Chandler:,"b' Look you have to realize I don\x92t think of you as a thin,\nbeautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize\nfor later! Look, what I mean is you\x92re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. '"
Chandler:,b' So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love\nyou.'
Chandler:,b' I\x92d carry you around in my pocket.'
Chandler:,b' Skidmark\x92s still got a way with the ladies.'
Rachel:,b' Hi Pheebs.'
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' Hi! I just want to apologize. I\x92m really sorry I was a baby.'
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at\nher.) Oh, you mean today.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah. Yeah, and y\x92know you-you deserve to win. And-and y\x92know\nI was thinking about it, if-if you\x92re Monica\x92s maid of honor that means I get to\nbe yours.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh yeah!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started\nputting some stuff together, y\x92know just in case\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh that\x92s so sweet thanks.'
Rachel:,"b' Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this\nis funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows\nPhoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was '"
Phoebe:,b' Ohh.'
Rachel:,"b' And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y\x92know \x91cause, people cry at\nweddings. (Starting to cry.) I\x92m just gonna grab a couple of these.'"
Phoebe:,b' This stuff is great!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was\nsaving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica\x92s something borrowed and it\x92s\nblue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica\x92s\nmaid\nof honor.'"
Rachel:,b' You do? Why?'
Phoebe:,b' Because I think it means more to you.'
Rachel:,"b' But Pheebs, y\x92know you earned it.'"
Phoebe:,"b""  It's fine. I mean, this is something that you\x92ve been thinking about\nsince you were what, 14? (She\x92s referring to the Halloween picture.)"""
Rachel:,"b' No, I was ten. I just developed early.'"
Phoebe:,b' (looking at the picture again) Man alive!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she\x92s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets\nsuddenly scared.)'"
Joey:,b' Great nap.'
Ross:,b' It really was.'
Joey:,b' (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!\n(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)'
Ross:,b' (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)'
