Ross:,"b"" Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's\none little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm\nconcerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"""
Rachel:,b' Come on! You guys can pee standing up.'
Chandler:,"b"" We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."""
Joey:,"b' Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.\nYou just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean\nthings, and then not even care."""
Ross:,b' Multiple orgasms!'
Chandler:,"b' So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,\nSat-ur-day night!'"
Joey:,"b' No plans, huh?'"
Chandler:,b' Not a one.'
Ross:,"b' Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, right, right, shut up.'"
Chandler:,"b"" No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting\nthere with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage\nto do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."""
Joey:,"b' Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. '"
Phoebe:,"b"" You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. """
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. """
Ross:,b' Tony?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I\ndon't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."""
Rachel:,b' (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey\npie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."""
Phoebe:,"b"" (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?"""
Rachel:,"b"" It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible."""
Ross:,"b' That guy, he burns me up.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He\ncalled me """
Chandler:,"b' Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three\nchoruses of ""You\'ll never make it on your own"".'"
Phoebe:,"b' (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.'"
Joey:,"b' My god, Angela.'"
Phoebe:,b' Are you gonna go over there?'
Joey:,"b"" No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One\nMississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to\nher) Hey, Angela. """
Joey:,b' You look good.'
Joey:,"b"" You don't say."""
Ross:,"b"" So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry\nthere too?"""
Rachel:,b' Who?'
Ross:,"b"" Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you\nboth, here?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Don't you have a laundry room in your building?"""
Ross:,"b"" Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat\nproblem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but\nthey're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"""
Rachel:,b' Sure.'
Joey:,"b"" Bob? Who the hell's Bob?"""
Joey:,"b' Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,\ntalking too.'"
Joey:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b"" Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together\ntonight? You know, as friends?"""
Joey:,"b' You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.'"
Joey:,"b"" Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."""
Joey:,"b"" Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's\nsmart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and\ncall myself an actor, but Bob is..."""
Joey:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b"" Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe\nAngela will come back to me."""
Joey:,"b' (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up\nwith her. Will you help me? Please?'"
Ross:,"b"" (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna\nbe me and Rachel."""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing\nthrough?"""
Ross:,"b"" It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal."""
Chandler:,"b"" It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're\ngoing on a date."""
Ross:,b' Nuh-uh.'
Chandler:,b' Yuh-huh.'
Ross:,"b"" So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the\nfirst time she's gonna see your underwear\x97you want it to be dirty?"""
Ross:,b' (sheepish) No.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?'"
Ross:,"b' Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my '"
Chandler:,b' There you go.'
Joey:,b' Yep.'
Joey:,b' Which what?'
Joey:,"b"" No, but he's..."""
Chandler:,b' Where are they? Where are they?'
Phoebe:,b' This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.'
Chandler:,"b"" It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some\npuppies."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Eww, I don't wanna do that."""
Chandler:,b' Here we go.'
Phoebe:,"b' Ok, have a good break-up.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, Janice.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,\nplease?"""
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' (covering) What... did you get me there? '
Chandler:,"b"" Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet."""
Chandler:,"b"" That's great. """
Chandler:,"b"" Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"""
Chandler:,"b"" That's it?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, it was really hard.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, you weren't there."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."""
Rachel:,b' But I saved it. I put my basket on top.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b"" What's goin' on?"""
Rachel:,"b' Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.'"
Ross:,b' Was your basket on top?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but, there were no suds.'"
Ross:,b' So?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, you know, no suds, no save.'"
Ross:,"b"" No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's\nmachine."""
Ross:,"b"" Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. """
Ross:,"b"" (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see\nhere. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry."""
Rachel:,"b"" That was amazing. I can't even send back soup."""
Ross:,"b"" Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do\nyou...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."""
Rachel:,"b"" What's that?"""
Ross:,b' '
Ross:,"b' Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed\nto use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? '"
Ross:,"b' Rach, have you never done this before?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.\nI'm a laundry virgin."""
Ross:,"b"" Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you\nwanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third\nfor your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."""
Rachel:,"b' (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these\nare white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?'"
Ross:,"b' (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.'"
Joey:,b' Oh my god.'
Joey:,"b"" I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not."""
Joey:,"b' So, you and Angela, huh?'"
Joey:,"b"" You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute\nnibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."""
Joey:,"b' Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it\nreally fast, and then the wound is exposed."""
Chandler:,"b"" Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out\nanymore. Janice."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can\ndo this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."""
Ross:,"b"" That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had\nto make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm\nsorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh."""
Rachel:,b' What uh-oh?'
Ross:,"b"" (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's\na song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ross, what's the matter?"""
Ross:,"b"" Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."""
Rachel:,"b' Come on, show me.'"
Ross:,"b"" All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your\nwhites, and now, everything's kinda pink."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, everything's pink."""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please\ndon't be upset, it could happen to anyone."""
Rachel:,"b"" Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big\nmarshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my\nown! I can't even do laundry!"""
Joey:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b"" Come on, they're close."""
Joey:,"b"" Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."""
Joey:,"b"" Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."""
Joey:,"b"" All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."""
Joey:,b' Ow!'
Joey:,"b' Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,\nwe can break them up."""
Joey:,"b' Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.\nI'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out\nand hits Janice in the eye)... boom."""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"""
Chandler:,b' (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the\nworst break-up in the history of the world. '
Phoebe:,b' Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you\nhad?'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, I don't know, a million?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm fine."""
Phoebe:,b' All right. '
Chandler:,"b"" I'm not fine. Here she comes."""
Phoebe:,b' Wait here. Breathe.'
Chandler:,b' How do you do that?'
Phoebe:,"b"" It's like a gift."""
Chandler:,b' We should always always break up together.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I'd like that."""
Ross:,"b"" You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."""
Rachel:,"b"" I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."""
Rachel:,"b' Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!'"
Rachel:,"b"" All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to\ntake me with it! """
Rachel:,b' (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?'
Ross:,"b' You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.'"
Rachel:,b' I could not have done this without you.'
Ross:,"b"" Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on\nan open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."""
Rachel:,b' Are you sure?'
Ross:,b' No.'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, are you sure you're ok?"""
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Does it still hurt?'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,"b"" (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm\ngonna do this."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey, how'd it go?"""
Joey:,b' Excellent.'
Ross:,"b"" What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."""
Rachel:,"b"" Where's Chandler?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, he needed some time to grieve.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm free! I'm free!"""
Phoebe:,b' That oughta do it.'
