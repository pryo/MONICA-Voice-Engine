Rachel:,b' Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.'
Phoebe:,b' Remembered what?'
Rachel:,"b"" It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw\nthis pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was\na little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"""
Chandler:,"b' Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his '"

Joey:,"b"" Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't\nmind getting a cup of coffee or something."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)"""
Chandler:,"b"" (quickly) H-He's in China!"""

Joey:,"b"" She's still asleep."""
Chandler:,"b"" So how'd it go?"""
Joey:,"b"" Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"""
Chandler:,"b"" The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know\nme."""
Joey:,"b"" Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me\ngreat. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was\nlike a ticker tape parade!"""
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade\nroute.'"
Joey:,"b"" It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all\nof a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was\nable to appreciate it on another level."""
Chandler:,"b"" I didn't know you had another level."""
