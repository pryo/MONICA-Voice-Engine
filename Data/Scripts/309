Phoebe:,"b"" Hey, it\x92s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching\nfootball, you could help."""
Rachel:,"b' No Mon, '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these\nthings. (just as she sits down)."""
Ross:,b' Halftime.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little\nthree on three going?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh! That would be sooo much fun!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, can I play too? I\x92ve never played football, like ever. '"
Joey:,"b' Great, you can cover Chandler.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no, no, I don\x92t, I don\x92t really wanna play.'"
Joey:,b' Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut\nclusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don\x92t say that I\ndon\x92t have goals!'
Joey:,"b' Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you\nget some fresh air, maybe it\x92ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don\x92t\nplay, everyone will be mad at you \x91cause the teams won\x92t be even. Come on.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, all right, I\x92ll play.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yay!!'
Rachel:,b' Let\x92s do it! Ross?'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Do you wanna play football?'
Ross:,"b' Um, Monica and I aren\x92t supposed to play football.'"
Joey:,b' Says who? Your mom?'
Chandler:,"b' No, no, no, you say that proudly.'"
Ross:,b' It was soo '
Ross:,"b' Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown\ndidn\x92t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose\nbreaking.'"
Ross:,b' Oh yeah! Then how come you didn\x92t get the Geller Cup?'
Rachel:,"b' Um, there was a Geller Cup?'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,\n\x91nobody won that game, \x91 and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy\nand.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it\nin the lake.'"
Chandler:,b' And was the curse lifted?'
Ross:,b' Anyway. That\x92s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever\nagain.'
Ross:,b' Can I see you for a second?'
Ross:,"b' All right, we\x92re gonna play.'"
Chandler:,"b' But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because\nmy Mom won\x92t let me cross the street.'"
Rachel:,"b' Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.'"
Ross:,b' Here you go. (throws her the ball)'
Rachel:,b' (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the\nface.'
Joey:,"b' All right, we have to pick captains.'"
Chandler:,b' And then Tineals.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so how do we decide that?'"
"Rachel, Chandler, and Joey:",b' What?'
Joey:,b' Thank you.'
Rachel:,"b' Monica, I\x92m your best friend.'"
Ross:,"b' Sweetie, don\x92t worry you\x92ll get picked. Chandler.'"

Ross:,"b' Okay. All right. So let\x92s see, let\x92s play from the trash can, to\nthe lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we\x92ll kick off.'"
Chandler:,b' Wow! Just like in the pros.'
Joey:,"b' (to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s block?'
Phoebe:,b' I thought you meant in life.'
Chandler:,b' The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but\nkicks Ross\x92s foot instead.)'
Ross:,b' Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!'
Chandler:,"b"" Sorry. I\x92m sorry. Y'know what, we\x92re just gonna throw it."""
Joey:,b' I got it. (catches the ball)'

Ross:,"b' Come on, let\x92s go!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, losers talk!'"
Chandler:,"b' No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.'"
Chandler:,"b' (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts\nhis hands between Ross\x92s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and\nlooks at him) You wanna go shotgun?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' (from the shotgun) Hike!'
Rachel:,b' Over here!'
Rachel:,b' (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!'
Chandler:,"b' Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the\nright. Okay. Break!'"
Rachel:,"b' Wait, what am I gonna do?'"
Ross:,"b' You, you go long.'"
Rachel:,"b' Wait, how long?'"
Ross:,b' Until we start to look very small.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'

Ross:,"b' Okay, it\x92s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you\nneed.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, I said it loud.'"
Chandler and Joey:,b' Yeah! Why don\x92t you stick around. You can sit right\nthere.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, that went well.'"
Joey:,b' I think so.'
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."""
Joey:,"b"" Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it\nmyself, y'know."""
Chandler:,"b"" Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of\nthat whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."""
Joey:,"b' Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I\x92ll let you have\nher.'"
Chandler:,"b' Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn\x92t\nI wouldn\x92t have a shot?'"
Joey:,"b' Well I don\x92t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don\x92t feel bad\nman, we all have our strengths. You\x92re better with numbers and stuff.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Math!! You\x92re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget\nabout it, you go for the girl, we\x92ll see who gets her."""
Ross:,"b' Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And\nsweetie..'"
