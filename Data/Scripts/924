Phoebe:,b' I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, right, because he's a scientist!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."""
Ross:,"b"" Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow."""

Phoebe:,b' You just did it again.'
Chandler:,"b"" I wouldn't read too much into it."""
Chandler:,"b"" David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."""

Ross:,"b' Well, what do'"
Rachel:,"b"" Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."""
Ross:,"b"" I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?"""
Joey:,b' I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.'
Ross:,"b"" I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!"""

Joey:,"b"" Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can."""
Rachel:,b' Ugh.'
Ross:,"b"" Alright, ok, let's do it.

Phoebe:,"b"" (looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?"""
Chandler:,"b"" I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one."""
Phoebe:,"b"" C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!"""
Phoebe:,b' (pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!'
Chandler:,"b"" Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."""
Chandler:,b' Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?'
Phoebe:,"b' (to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.'"
Ross:,"b"" Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)"""
Ross:,b' Get Out!'
Ross:,"b"" Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?"""
Ross:,"b' Oh my God, wh-what happened?'"
Ross:,b' I knew that was him!'
Ross:,"b' (holding her hand) Hey, you ok?'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."""
Ross:,"b"" (standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)"""
Chandler:,"b' (exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!'"
Chandler:,"b' Monica, that was also true an'"
Chandler:,b' But...'
Chandler:,b' What about the obsessive cleaning?'
Chandler:,b' You ok?'
Phoebe:,b' Mike wins?'
Chandler:,"b"" No, you didn't."""
Chandler:,"b"" Because I'm gonna play for ya."""
Phoebe:,"b"" You can't do that!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."""
Chandler:,"b"" (In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."""
Chandler:,"b"" (Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart."""
Chandler:,"b"" All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."""
Phoebe:,"b"" It's like watching porn!"""
Chandler:,"b"" And that's... how... it's done!"""
Chandler:,"b"" I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"""
Chandler:,"b"" I don't know."""
Chandler:,b' '
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest.'"
Ross:,"b"" I don't think they saw us."""
Ross:,b' (apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?'
Ross:,"b"" I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."""
Ross:,"b"" I'm sorry... we... we can't."""
Ross:,"b"" I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)"""
Rachel:,b' What?'
