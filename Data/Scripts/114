Chandler:,b' Any contact?'
Ross:,b' She lent me an egg once.'
Joey:,"b"" You're in!"""
Ross:,"b' Aw, right.'"
Ross:,b' Hey. (stutters something incoherent)'
Chandler:,"b"" Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel\nthing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian\x97I don't think we need a third... """
Joey:,"b' Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.'"
Ross:,b' An egg?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, you\'re gonna go up to her and say, ""Here\'s your egg back, I\'m\nreturning your egg.""'"
Chandler:,"b"" I think it's winning."""
Ross:,"b"" I think it's insane."""
Chandler:,"b"" She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."""
Joey:,"b"" Think it'll work?"""
Chandler:,"b"" No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."""
Rachel:,"b' Do what, do what?'"
Rachel:,"b"" No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,\nstill, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"""
Rachel:,"b' Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?'"
Joey:,"b' Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...'"
Joey:,"b"" No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out\nwith me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."""
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...'"
Joey:,"b"" Pathetic mess? I know, but\x97come on, man, she's needy, she's\nvulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and\neats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'\nthis."""
Ross:,b' Hi. She said yes.'
Chandler:,"b"" Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in\nRoss' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?"""
Joey:,b' (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,\nno trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."""
Chandler:,b' ...And what did you bring?'
Chandler:,b' Janice?'
Chandler:,"b"" (angrily) Hey, it's Janice."""
Chandler:,"b"" Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. """
Joey:,"b"" No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with\nLorraine. Just calm down. """
Chandler:,"b"" Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped\ntwice in the last five months!"""
Joey:,"b"" (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I\ncan't go when I'm nervous."""
Chandler:,"b"" I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and\nyells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"""
Rachel:,"b' Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.'"
Rachel:,"b' Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had\nsex. (imitating) ""Was it good for you?""'"
Rachel:,"b"" How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you\nwant to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.'"
Rachel:,"b' Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.\nIt's perfect."""
Phoebe:,"b' Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.'"
Rachel:,b' Or?'
Phoebe:,"b' Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."""
Joey:,"b' Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?'"
Chandler:,"b"" That's OK."""
Joey:,"b"" (to Lorraine) We can't do that."""
Chandler:,"b"" (disgusted) What? What can't you do?"""
Joey:,"b' Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, we might be leaving now.'"
Chandler:,"b' Tell me it\'s ""you and me"" we.'"
Joey:,"b"" She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm\nnot even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."""
Chandler:,"b' Ok, you can not do this to me.'"
Joey:,"b"" You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."""
Joey:,"b"" I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,\nChandler."""
Chandler:,b' I hope she throws up on you.'
Chandler:,b' So...'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, what a crappy night!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...\nother patrons look at him) How ya doin'?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.\nAnother drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?"""
Chandler:,"b"" You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we\nget a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"""
Chandler:,"b"" That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always\nwanted to know..."""
Chandler:,"b' No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.'"

Rachel:,"b' Oh my god. Janice, hi!'"
Chandler:,b' Janice is gonna go away now.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Joey, look who it is.'"
Joey:,b' (in disbelief) Whoa.'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, good, Joey's home now."""
Ross:,"b"" I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole\num, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los\nAngeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."""
Ross:,"b' The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,\npersonal friend.'"
Ross:,b' If you wanna put a label on it.'
Ross:,"b"" Nope, nope, that's it. """

Rachel:,"b"" And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa."""
Chandler:,"b"" How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?"""
Joey:,"b"" I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's."""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."""
Chandler:,"b' Hi, Just Janice.'"
Joey:,"b"" (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will."""
Ross:,"b' So, um, what do you do for a living?'"
Ross:,"b"" Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited\nCarol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. """
Ross:,b' Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?'
Ross:,"b"" Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's\ntry scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.

Chandler:,b' Call me!'
Ross:,"b"" You did so. I swear, I swear\x97(noticing Kristin's absence) How long\nhas she been in the bathroom?"""
Ross:,"b"" Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had\nin 9 years. """
Ross:,"b' Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still\npretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off\nand eats it.)'"
Ross:,"b' No, it\'s just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life""\nthing. Well, do I have to?
