Ross:,"b' Hey, remember when I had a monkey?'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, what, what was I thinking?'"
Joey:,"b' (he\x92s just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what\x92s with the 20\npercent tip? Did I do something wrong?'"
Chandler:,b' Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.'
Joey:,b' Y\x92know what\x92s more generous than that?! Fifty percent!\nY\x92know what\x92s even more generous than that?!!'
Chandler:,b' I see where you\x92re goin\x92!'
Ross:,b' What\x92s up with the greed Joe?'
Joey:,"b' All right, look I\x92m sorry you guys, but it\x92s just that I gotta\nget these new head shots made. And they\x92re really expensive, y\x92know? I\x92m\ndown to like three! Well, actually two \x91cause one of \x91em I kinda blackened in\nsome teeth\x97Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)'"
Ross:,"b' Well isn\x92t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I\nmean, can\x92t-can\x92t you pick up, I don\x92t know, an extra shift here?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Or, y\x92know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if\nyou\x92ve got y\x92know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it)\ngoin\x92 on. Wow! I still have it!'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, wait! Wait! Don\x92t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe\nyou\x92ll get that job!'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down\non me all the time!'"
Chandler:,"b' (reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.'"
Joey:,"b' No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?\nLet\x92s see uh, well I don\x92t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer\ndoing that at the home office y\x92know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want\nlike some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,b' Uhh do it?'
Joey:,"b' Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)'"
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Hey, what have you guys been up to?'"
Phoebe:,b' Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!'
Ross:,b' Wow!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!'"
Joey:,b' Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Now, we can kick anybody\x92s ass!'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' After one class? I don\x92t think so.'
Rachel:,b' What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and\npretend you\x92re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!'
Ross:,"b' Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,\nthat\x92s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there\x92s a\nconcept you should really be familiar with. It\x92s what the Japanese call (he holds two\nfingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.'"
Rachel:,b' Isn\x92t that a kind of sushi?'
Ross:,"b' No, it\x92s a concept!'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah it is! It is! It\x92s freshwater eel!'
Ross:,"b' All right, maybe it means that too\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!'
Ross:,b' Y\x92know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don\x92t even care! '
Phoebe:,b' (deadpan) Come on Ross. We\x92re sorry. Please tell us what it is.'
Ross:,b' Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi\ncan you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!'
Phoebe:,b' You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or\nyour kettle of fish?'
Ross:,"b' (moves closer) All I\x92m saying is, it\x92s one thing being prepared\nfor an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I\ndon\x92t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel\x92s and screams) '"
Ross:,"b' All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn\x92t mean you\nhave unagi. (Does the finger thing.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (To Phoebe) Ooh! Y\x92know what? If we made reservations, we could\nhave unagi in about a half-hour.'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what\x85 (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey-hey, is Monica here?'"
Phoebe:,b' No.'
Ross:,b' No.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, look I need your help, I don\x92t know what to get her for\nValentine\x92s Day.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, Valentine\x92s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn\x92t\nget her a calendar!'"
Chandler:,b' (laughs) She was working on Valentine\x92s Day so we\x92re\ncelebrating it tonight.'
Joey:,"b' Ohh, hey! Why don\x92t you book a date for both of you at one of those\nromantic spas?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, Joey, that\x92s actually a really good idea!'"
Joey:,"b' And of course, crotchless panties. '"
Chandler:,"b' Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her\nbrother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I\ncan\x92t do that we promised we\x92d make each other gifts this year.'"
Rachel:,"b' Aw, I love that.'"
Phoebe:,b' You guys!'
Joey:,"b' You can\x92t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of\nscissors and you just cut\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like\nso much fun.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?'"
Chandler:,b' I made a\x85 (Does one of those gibberish words.)'
Phoebe:,b' What is that?'
Chandler:,b' Nothing!'
Ross:,b' So what are you gonna do?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She\ntakes out a sock that\x92s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and\ntwo other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Now, it\x92s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel\x92s\nface and they both laugh.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (admiring his work) This, this actually is a\x85 (Does the same\ngibberish word from before.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine\x92s Day\ngifts?'"
Chandler:,b' Do we have to make the entire thing?'
Chandler:,"b' Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place\nwhere I-I made it and pick-pick it up.'"
Chandler:,b' (sticking his head back in) What?'
Joey:,"b' (to the receptionist) Hi uh, I\x92m Joey Tribbiani and with all do\nrespect I\x92d like to donate some fluids.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh that\x92s too bad. I\x92ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks at\nhim in horror.) Uh, are you sure there\x92s no studies I can participate in?'"
Joey:,b' Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to\none.)'
Joey:,"b' But it\x92s $2,000.'"
Joey:,b' Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on\nattractive nurse receptionists.'
Ross:,b' '
Phoebe:,b' Ross!!!'
Rachel:,b' What the hell was that?!'
Ross:,b' A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing\nevery time now.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, '"
Ross:,"b' Perhaps. Now I\x92m curious, at what point during those girlish screams\nwould you have begun to '"
Rachel:,"b' All right, so we weren\x92t '"
Ross:,"b' I\x92m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but\nI\x97look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage\nand Ross screams\x85) '"
Joey:,"b' (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.\nWhere could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to\nreveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back\nat his script.)'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' Unagi. I\x92m always aware.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?'"
Ross:,b' What\x92s up?'
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t figure out what to make Monica.'
Ross:,"b' Oh, why don\x92t you make her one of your little jokes.'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that\nlooks homemade?'
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? She\x92d-she\x92d love this. (Picks up a model of\nthe Saturn V rocket, that\x92s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it\x92s an\nexact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to\nthe moon.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn\x92t actually land on the moon. But\nyou-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return\nsafely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the\nChristmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the\nfamous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Wait a minute, I can\x92t give this to her.'"
Ross:,b' Why not?'
Chandler:,"b' Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate\nMonica"" on the bottom.'"
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Rachel:,"b' Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,\nand notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then\nhe holds it out as if he\x92s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws\nit down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a\npair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he\njust removed.) I can\x92t do it. I can\x92t do it. (He throws them both down and\ncontinues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A\nmixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, come here! Come here.'"
Chandler:,"b' Now, it\x92s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.'"
Chandler:,b' But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.'
Chandler:,b' (momentarily terrified) Maybe we\x92ll have to listen and see!'
Chandler:,b' Okay!'
Chandler:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s a sock bunny.'
Chandler:,b' Not really.'
Chandler:,"b' I see. Y\x92know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, it\x92s okay. I don\x92t\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They\nboth run into the bedroom.)'"
Chandler:,b' Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) '
Chandler:,b' You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.'
Chandler:,b' Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)'
Chandler:,b' You have done enough!'
Chandler:,"b' No you don\x92t\x97get it in black, not brown.'"
Chandler:,b' Oop!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, it\x92s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.'"
Joey's Look-A-Like:,b' Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Just\ngettin\x92 a soda! (Does so.)'
Joey's Look-A-Like:,b' I\x92m Joey! How are you doin\x92?!'
Joey:,b' (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How '
Joey:,"b' Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.'"
Chandler:,b' Who the hell is Carl?!'
Joey:,"b' Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a\nmedical research project.'"
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,\naren\x92t they?'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y\x92know? The\nonly problem is, Carl\x92s acting is\x85 (Does the international hand symbol for\nso-so.)'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, he\x92s the reason I didn\x92t get that big '"
Joey:,b' (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)'
Phoebe:,b' Pat Sajak?'
Rachel:,b' Yep!'
Phoebe:,b' Alex Trebek?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, of course!'"
Phoebe:,b' Chuck Woolery?'
Rachel:,"b' Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host,\nwho\x92s ass I cannot kick.'"
Rachel:,b' Say it!'
Phoebe:,b' Say we are unagi!'
Ross:,b' It\x92s not something you are! It\x92s something you have!'
Rachel:,b' Say it!'
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you\ncan get very, very hurt!'"
Joey:,"b' All right Carl, we\x92re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s right! And what are you not gonna do?'
Joey:,"b' (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey\nsilences him with a grunt.)'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s us.'
Joey:,"b' That\x92s right, $2,000.'"
Joey:,b' Damnit Carl!'
Chandler:,b' Oh my good God.'
Chandler:,"b' Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, the mixed tape.'"
Chandler:,b' No! You\x92re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs\naway with a look that could kill on her face.)'
Ross:,b' It\x92s a great class.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)\nUmm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the\nwoman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?'"
Ross:,b' No. No-no. No. What would '
Ross:,b' Yes that\x92s right.'
Ross:,"b' I tired attacking two women, did not work.'"
Ross:,"b' No, I mean it\x92s okay, I mean, they\x92re-they\x92re my friends.\nIn fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn\x92t. That\x92s why I\x92m\nhere. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that\x92s a no.'"
Chandler:,"b' I am so, so, so, so sorry!'"
Chandler:,"b' And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and\ndo anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Come on Monica, it\x92s our Valentine\x92s Day. Please?\nPlease-please, please?'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. (They hug.)'
Chandler:,"b' So, are we going in there?'"
Ross:,"b' Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t like sitting up here! I\x92m just gonna over\x85 (She\nstarts to get up.)'
Phoebe:,b' (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!'
Phoebe:,b' Why is Ross doing that?'
Ross:,b' '
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!'
Phoebe:,b' We should help him!'
Rachel:,"b' I\x85 Well, I don\x92t think they need any help.'"
