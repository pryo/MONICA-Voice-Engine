Ross:,b' Hey! What are you guys looking at?'
Joey:,"b' Oh, it\x92s a poster for that World War I movie that I\x92m in, check\nit out.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah? Wow! It looks '
Joey:,b' Uh-huh! I know. I\x92m coming soon to a theater near you! I\x92m in\nTHX! I\x92m unsuitable for children!'
Ross:,b' Now I cannot wait to see this.'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah, it\x92s already generating Oscar buzz.'"
Phoebe:,b' I started that!'
Joey:,b' I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and\nyou\x92re all invited! (They all gasp.)'
Joey:,b' Sure! Why not?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well obviously I won\x92t be able to come, for those of you who\nhaven\x92t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y\x92know, I just want\nto take a moment and thank you guys for how great you\x92ve been during this time. I\nreally couldn\x92t have done it without you. And I have '"
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the\ncouch) Come on people! Please make some room!'"
Ross:,"b' Uh sweetie, maybe you\x92d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the\ngreen armchair.)'"
Rachel:,b' You. Like you haven\x92t done enough.'
Ross:,"b' Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.\nI mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it\x92s the\nmale, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I\x92d be far away in the sea. (He sits\nback down.)'"
Rachel:,b' God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh I know, I\x92ve been there. I remember toward the end\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that\x92s a great story. Can you tell it\nto me when you\x92re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To\nthe baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!'"
Chandler:,b' Let\x92s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)'
Chandler:,b' Hey! Did you have the baby yet?'
Rachel:,b' Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? \x91Cause I\x92ll\ndo it.'
Rachel:,"b' They sent me home from work. They were like, ""Start your maternity\nleave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby."" Well y\x92know what? Screw \x91em!\nIf they don\x92t want me there, I\x92ll just hang out with you guys.'"
Phoebe:,b' Or you can do '
Joey:,b' Hello?'
Joey:,b' One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!'
Joey:,b' Oh my God. So that\x92s it?! I only get to bring one guest?'
Joey:,"b' (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra\nticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.'"
Rachel:,b' (overhearing that) What-what about me?'
Joey:,b' You said you didn\x92t want to go.'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just\nbecause I\x92m pregnant you think I\x92m invisible.'
Joey:,b' Definitely not invisible.'
Chandler:,"b' He\x92s not snoozing, he\x92s teaching a class.'"
Chandler:,b' I haven\x92t seen this dress.'
Phoebe:,"b' Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.\nWhat does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.'"
Joey:,b' Well uh\x85I think I want to take Chandler.'
Phoebe:,"b' (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)\nPhoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe\x97Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going\noff.)'"
Chandler:,b' You really want to take me?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Yeah! I mean I\x92m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but\ny\x92know Chandler always supported my career. He\x92s paid for acting classes and\nhead shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.'"
Chandler:,b' So you\x92re never actually going to pay me back?'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it\x92s-it\x92s\neverything. Y\x92know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was\nreally nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn\x92t get parts that I really\nwanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn\x92t believe in myself.'"
Chandler:,b' I always knew you were gonna make it. I\x92m so proud of you.'
Joey:,b' Thanks. That means a lot to me.'
Phoebe:,"b' Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.'"
Joey:,b' (in a manly voice) I\x92m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)'
Chandler:,"b' (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I\x92m gonna go spit. (He goes into\nthe bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I have to pee. If I don\x92t come out in five minutes it\x92s\nbecause I\x92ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' When she comes out, you hold her nose, I\x92ll blow in her mouth, and\nthe kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.'"
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t know. I-I think it\x92s still gonna be a while.'
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re on!'
Phoebe:,b' One '
Phoebe:,b' Fine! I\x92ll call Zurich and move some money around.'
Rachel:,"b' (calling from the bathroom) All right, who\x92s turn is it to help me\nget up!'"
Phoebe:,b' No one\x92s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!'
Chandler:,b' This is so exciting! It\x92s so glamorous! People taking our\npicture. How do I look?'
Joey:,b' A little tall.'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler\ndoes so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s just so glamorous.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you\x92re still pregnant. Oh, I\x92m\nsorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y\x92know what? You look great. Yeah, like\nfifty bucks.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a\nsqueeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' It\x92s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?'"
Phoebe:,b' Fine! You\x92re on!'
Phoebe:,"b' Until then, General Grant, why don\x92t you set up camp (She puts the\nbill in her bra) right there.'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor\x92s appointment.'
Ross:,"b' Rach, we gotta go.'"
Rachel:,b' In a minute!!!'
Ross:,"b' People ask me why we\x92re not together, I just don\x92t know what to\ntell them.'"
Rachel:,"b' (entering) All right, all right. Let\x92s go!'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor\x92s keeping the office\nopen late for us, but if you hurry\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' No, I\x92m fine.'"
Ross:,b' Really? You don\x92t think that\x92s a little inappropriate.\n(She\x92s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)'
Phoebe:,b' Good God man don\x92t anger it.'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am\nsomewhat comfortable.'"
Ross:,b' Fine! Fine! Y\x92know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You\x92re the\nmommy.'
Rachel:,b' Oh uh-uh pal! Don\x92t call me mommy! It\x92s bad enough you call\nyour own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)'
Joey:,"b' (onscreen) ""I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all\nalong."" '"
Joey:,"b' (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It\x92s my big fight scene coming up.\n(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he\x92s asleep.)'"
Rachel:,b' Ross.'
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,b' Can I ask you something?'
Ross:,b' Uh-huh.'
Rachel:,b' When Carol was pregnant with Ben\x85'
Ross:,b' Mmm?'
Rachel:,b' \x85were you this irritating?'
Ross:,b' Wow!'
Rachel:,b' Excuse me?!'
Ross:,"b' Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you\x92ve been a little short with me\nlately. I\x92m not trying to irritate you.'"
Rachel:,b' Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.'
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don\x92t we not speak\nuntil then.'"
Rachel:,"b' (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That\x92s\ngreat!'"
Ross:,b' Y\x92know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to\ndeliver a baby that\x92s half human and half pure evil!'
Rachel:,"b' Hi Dr. Long, how are you?'"
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) Oh, you\x92re nice to her.'"
Rachel:,b' She has the drugs!'
Rachel:,b' Okay. (Rachel lies back.)'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Eh, just a tad.'"
Ross:,b' Do them!!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, we are ready to try anything.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Great! We will do all of those.'
Ross:,b' You\x92ve got to be kidding me!'
Chandler:,b' Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!'
Joey:,b' You liked it? You really liked it?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh-ho-ho, yeah!'"
Joey:,b' Which part exactly?'
Chandler:,b' The whole thing! Can we go?'
Joey:,"b' Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.'"
Chandler:,"b' I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?'"
Chandler:,b' I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.'
Joey:,b' You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn\x92t take any of my\nsuggestions! That\x92s for coming buddy. I\x92ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)'
Chandler:,"b' Don\x92t go! I\x92m sorry. I\x92m so sorry! (Sees another guy\nwho is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!\n(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.'"
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,\ncaster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, there is one thing that we haven\x92t tried, but someone thinks\nthat, (mimicking Ross) ""That will open up a can of worms.""'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s sex.'
Ross:,b' Monica!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh I-I don\x92t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you\nhad sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. '"
Ross:,"b' Monica, what is the matter with you?'"
Rachel:,b' Why? Why today?'
Ross:,"b' What?! While she\x92s been going through this hell, you\x92ve been\nmaking money?! You\x92re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers\nher head and shakes it yes.)'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92ll take that bet.'
Ross:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x92m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!'"
Ross:,b' Can I get some of that action?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh honey, don\x92t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow\x92s the\nday.'"
Joey:,b' Hey! Sleeping beauty!'
Chandler:,b' Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I\nstill feel so bad!'
Joey:,"b' (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m so sorry.'
Joey:,"b' Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between\nus! Okay? You\x92ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took\nyou to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?'"
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Joey:,"b' Give me a number, I don\x92t want to owe you anything!'"
Chandler:,"b' You don\x92t owe me anything, I don\x92t want you money\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Ah-ah-ah! We\x92re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head\nshots. Right, how much were those?'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know, five hundred dollars?'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, so that\x92s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,\nthat\x92s\x85 (Pauses to figure it out.)'"
Chandler:,b' Do you want a calculator?'
Joey:,b' Please! '
Chandler:,b' Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was\nright.)'
Joey:,"b' All right, what else?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap\nclasses\x85'"
Joey:,b' Which we\x92re still keeping under our hats!'
Chandler:,b' Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play\nwhere you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out\nJamaican. '
Joey:,"b' What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) ""The\nsouth will rise again man.""'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, money well spent!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Okay, so I\x92m writing you a check for\x85So you fell asleep\nduring my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?'"
Ross:,"b' Come on, finish your enchilada.'"
Rachel:,b' Ross I\x97We tried all the spicy food. It\x92s not working.'
Ross:,"b' Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha\x85 Oh God! So\x85so hot!\n(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my\x97(Laughs.) By the way, you don\x92t want to touch the pepper\nand then touch your eye.'"
Rachel:,"b' I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes\nme want to have sex with you.'"
Ross:,b' Stop it.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We\nknow what\x92s gonna work! It\x92s doctor recommended!'"
Ross:,"b' I\x92m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I\x92m\ndying.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh come on Ross, we\x92ve done it before we\x92ll do it again,\nit\x92ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.'"
Ross:,"b' This is insane, I\x92m not gonna make love to you just so that\nyou\x92ll go into labor.'"
Rachel:,b' Make love? What are you a girl?'
Ross:,b' Always a great way to get in a man\x92s pants.'
Rachel:,"b' But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of\nme as a ketchup bottle, y\x92know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just\nto get something to come out.'"
Ross:,b' I love when you talk dirty to me.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I know it. You\x92re right. That\x92s not sexy. Oh\x85Oh!\n(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed\nover and get it. (Tries too, but can\x92t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on Ross! I\x92m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now\nyou finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.'"
Ross:,b' Y\x92know what?'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' Forget it.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh wow! What now Ross you\x92re not gonna talk? How on earth will you\never annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you\x92d think\nthe damn jalepeno would\x92ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That\x92s not\nenough\x85 (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m getting that baby out of you!'
Rachel:,b' (breaking the kiss) Oh God!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I know.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.'
Ross:,"b' I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the\nkeys?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' We\x92re having a baby.'
Rachel:,"b' I didn\x92t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but\ndo you think we have time to\x85'"
Ross:,b' Not so much.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Thank you!'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Is Rachel having the baby?'
Phoebe:,b' They\x92re at the coffeehouse.'
Phoebe:,b' We know it\x92s a girl! (Exits.)'
