Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Dinner was good! '
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m just saying hi! Now I\x92m gonna go! '
Phoebe:,"b' (To him) Oh, well hello there.'"
Phoebe:,b' (To Monica) I didn\x92t see this on the menu.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, so you're Monica\x92s boss?"""
Phoebe:,b' Oh! I sous stand.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh you\x85you made pesto?'
Phoebe:,b' Would you say your pesto is the best-o?'
Phoebe:,b' I made it myself.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, it\x92s no pesto.'"
Chandler:,"b' You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I\nget around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?'"
Chandler:,b' What\x92s funny about that?'
Ross:,b' (running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.'
Chandler:,"b' Hey that\x92s okay. So, where do you want to go?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.'"
Chandler:,b' The '
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' Again?!'
Ross:,b' Yeah!!'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m telling you, I like the food!'"
Chandler:,b' You like the '
Ross:,b' Did that guy just call you Toby?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, he thinks that\x92s my name.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, why don\x92t you correct him?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh it\x92s been going on way to long now. Y\x92know, I mean the\nfirst time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn\x92t say\nanything. And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"" And\nI-I wanted a donut. And now it\x92s five years later, the donut\x92s gone and I\x92m\nstill Toby.'"
Ross:,b' Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!'
Chandler:,"b' No! That would be so awkward! Look\x97Besides, we work in different\ndepartments. He\x92s on the sixth floor y\x92know? So he calls me Toby once in a\nwhile. What\x92s the big deal? It could be worse, it\x92s not like he\x92s calling\nme Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)'"
Ross:,b' (laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes\nsomething.) Oh my God! Chandler '
Chandler:,b' Shh! It is a family name!'
Ross:,"b' Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?'"
Joey's Co-Star:,"b' Drake, I\x92ve discovered the reason for all your headaches\nand memory loss.'"
Joey's Co-Star:,b' Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It\nseems your body is rejecting Jessica\x92s brain.'
Joey's Co-Star:,"b' Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize\nantibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the\nbrain.'"
Joey's Co-Star:,"b' We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica\x92s body, it was\ngone.'"
Joey:,"b' (To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.'"
Rachel:,b' Well don\x92t\x97What happened to Jessica\x92s body?!'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m not telling, you\x92ll have to see it on TV!'"
Rachel:,b' You don\x92t know do you?'
Joey:,"b' No, couldn\x92t care less.'"
Joey's Co-Star:,b' Hey good scene man.'
Joey:,b' Hey you too!'
Joey's Co-Star:,b' Alright.'
Joey:,b' What? You weren\x92t in it.'
Rachel:,b' Oh! (Motions to Joey\x92s co-star.)'
Joey:,"b' Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?'"
Joey:,"b' This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.'"
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, Joey probably thinks I\x92ll just embarrass him. Y\x92know, he\nthinks I\x92m some kind of a soap opera nut\x97Which I\x92m not! I\x92m not.\nAlthough I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts\nstroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog\x92s name is Wally. Well look at that,\nI\x92m just stroking your arm.'"
Joey:,b' (grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from\nKash.)'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, we\x92re leaving. Bye Kash.'"
Rachel:,b' Say hi to Wally.'
Phoebe:,b' Ooh Monica!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! I had the '
Phoebe:,b' But why?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well maybe he was just nervous, y\x92know you can be very\nintimidating. And besides I\x92ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken\ndown a peg or two.'"
Phoebe:,"b' But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another\nchance? Please?'"
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he\ngot the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.'"
Phoebe:,b' Love it!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,"b' Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought\nyou were charming.'"
Rachel:,b' I thought I was a complete idiot.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, I\x92m with you. He even asked me if I thought you\x92d go out\nwith him.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh! Oh, I think I\x92m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?'"
Joey:,b' I said no.'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Joey:,b' What? I\x85I just figured since you\x92re pregnant you\x92re not\ngonna be seeing people.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did\nhe say when you told him I was pregnant?'"
Joey:,b' I didn\x92t tell him. I didn\x92t know if you were telling people.\nThis is back when I thought Kash was still people.'
Rachel:,"b' Good-good, don\x92t tell him. Don\x92t tell him. Just have him call\nme okay?'"
Joey:,"b' Rach look, I really don\x92t think that\x92s such a great\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you go do it! I\x92ll come back to that set! I\x92ll meet more\nactors! I\x92ll meet \x91em all!'"
Chandler:,b' Hey Bob.'
Chandler:,"b' If I see him, I\x92ll ask.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' We\x92re on a semi-first name basis.'
Chandler:,"b' Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don\x92t know if\nhe has what it takes.'"
Chandler:,b' But this is eleven. It\x92s almost twice as hard up here.'
Chandler:,b' I think it\x92s best sir.'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know what you should do, just toss \x91em in the shedder and\nclaim you never got \x91em.'"
Chandler:,b' What does a guy have to '
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' But\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Okay, but you can\x92t fire him today.'"
Phoebe:,b' Because I\x92m dumping him today.'
Phoebe:,b' He '
Phoebe:,"b' Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) ""I\x92m so worried about\nyou."" Uck! Be a man!'"
Phoebe:,"b' You can\x92t fire him and dump him the same day, he\x92ll kill\nhimself.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I\x92ll kill '"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. But the question is who\x92s gonna go first. \x91Cause whoever\ngoes second is the bitch.'
Phoebe:,"b' Come on! The boss that fires a guy that\x92s just been dumped, bitch!\nAnd the woman who dumps a guy that\x92s just been fired, blond bitch!'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh.\nBut\x97Screw you I\x92m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Sure, what\x92s up?'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I\x92m not drinking\non this date tonight. ""Umm, I\x92m a recovering alcoholic. I\x92m a Mormon,""\nor ""I got so hammered last night I\x92m still a little drunk?""'"
Ross:,b' (entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' So, what do you want to do tonight? There\x92s a Ukrainian film at the\nAngelica that\x92s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?'"
Joey:,b' No. No. But I\x92ll go see a normal person movie with ya.'
Ross:,b' Rach? You wanna come?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, I can\x92t. I got a date.'"
Ross:,b' A date?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?'
Ross:,"b' Why no, it\x92s the opposite of weird. It\x92s-it\x92s uh, regular.\nIt\x92s-it\x92s uh, it\x92s mundane. It\x92s actually uh, a little dull.'"
Joey:,b' It\x92s no Ukrainian film.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah\x97Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)'
Ross:,b' A date?! She\x92s-she\x92s got a date?! With who?'
Joey:,b' I set her up with this actor on my show.'
Ross:,b' You set her up?!'
Joey:,b' No'
Ross:,b' Joey what-what were you thinking?!'
Joey:,"b' Well, I was thinking that it\x92d probably be okay because Ross\nhasn\x92t gone out with Rachel in five years!'"
Ross:,"b' Joey, I\x92m not worried about her! I\x92m worried about my baby!\nWhoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor\ntaking them?'"
Joey:,b' Hey! I\x92m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I\x92m\nnot sure. I think they\x92re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten\nIsland.'
Ross:,b' A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous\nthose are?!'
Joey:,b' Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like\nfive miles an hour?'
Ross:,b' Why don\x92t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that\x92s\na fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That\x92s fun too! Whew!!'
Joey:,"b' Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.'"
Ross:,b' Hi. I-I hear you\x92re going on a ferry tonight.'
Ross:,b' A bit of a daredevil are we?'
Rachel:,b' (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too\nslutty\x97Hi Kash!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah! All right, I\x92ll see you guys later.'"
Ross:,b' Okay. Have a great time you guys.'
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Ross:,b' Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the\nentire sentence.)'
Phoebe:,b' Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' It will be\x85in a minute. Listen, Tim you\x92re a really great guy.'"
Phoebe:,b' Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I\x92m\njust\x97I\x92m in a place in my life right now where I\x85I\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Oh-oh no she doesn\x92t! I know what that is. You can stay.'
Joey:,b' So what movie do you want to see\x97And not another one I have to read.\nOkay? I get enough of that from books.'
Ross:,b' Books?'
Joey:,"b' All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it\x92s like '"
Ross:,"b' Well, I tell you what. Why don\x92t we uh, why don\x92t we just stay\nhere? Let\x92s not see a movie, we\x92ll just hang.'"
Joey:,b' And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?'
Ross:,"b' Hey, if that\x92s what you want to do I\x92m not gonna say no.'"
Joey:,b' Dude! What is going on?!'
Ross:,b' I just\x85I have to find out how it went.'
Joey:,b' Why?'
Ross:,b' This guy could be my baby\x92s stepfather!'
Joey:,b' They go on one date and you\x92re worried about them getting married?!\nHe\x92s not you!'
Ross:,b' I just\x97I-I can\x92t believe she\x92s-she\x92s dating?!'
Joey:,"b' Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?'"
Ross:,b' I don\x92t know! I guess I just can\x92t believe any of this is\nhappening.'
Joey:,b' What do you mean?'
Ross:,b' It\x92s just I always thought when I had '
Joey:,b' That\x92s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!'
Ross:,b' No! No I can\x92t. I mean Rachel\x92s out with some guy. My baby went\nwith her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your\nwife, is your wife Rachel?'"
Ross:,b' It used to be. Now she doesn\x92t really have a face. Smokin\x92 body\nthough.'
Joey:,"b' Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn\x92t Rachel.'"
Ross:,b' No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?'
Joey:,"b' I know, but I don\x92t think that\x92s what she wants.'"
Ross:,"b' No, it\x92s not what I want either. I mean I-I can\x92t force myself\nto fall in love with her again now.'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It\x92s not\ngonna be what you thought, but no matter what there\x92s gonna be a brand new little\nbaby, '"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, I tell you what. Let\x92s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh?\nWhatever you want. Come on!'"
Ross:,b' (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.'
Joey:,"b' No, I said fun!'"
Chandler:,b' Hey Bobby.'
Chandler:,"b' Uhh yeah. Yeah, it\x92s (Points down the hall) right, right down\nthere. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate\noff of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay Bob listen uhh, I\x92m the reason you didn\x92t get the job\nup here.'"
Chandler:,b' Bob!'
Chandler:,b' Well that puts me in a difficult position.'
Phoebe:,b' Monica!'
Phoebe:,b' (simultaneously) I\x92m breaking up with you!'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m, I\x92m breaking up with you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I\x92m just\x97I\x92m\x85I\x92m just not ready\nfor a relationship right now.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh that\x92s good, the chemistry thing for us too.'"
Phoebe:,"b' And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves,\nwhich disgusts Monica.)'"
Ross:,b' Hello.'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' Well, how was the date?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well I\x92m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy\nbars, what do you think?'"
Ross:,b' Uh-huh. What happened?'
Rachel:,b' I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.'
Ross:,"b' Ah, he didn\x92t uh, take it so well?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well better than you, but y\x92know still not what you want.'"
Ross:,b' Oh?'
Rachel:,"b' He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear\nthose hemorrhoids are a bitch.""'"
Ross:,b' He sounds swell.'
Rachel:,b' Doesn\x92t he?'
Ross:,"b' Hey, wanna\x85wanna a little cheering up?'"
Rachel:,b' Yes.'
Ross:,b' Sit down. '
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Guess whose middle name is Muriel.'
Rachel:,b' (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?'
Ross:,b' Yeah-ha!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God. (Laughs)'
Ross:,b' I\x92m sorry about your date.'
Rachel:,b' Oh it\x92s all right. I\x92m guess I\x92m just done with the whole\ndating thing. It\x92s one more thing in my life that\x92s suddenly completely\ndifferent. This is hard.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months\nyou\x92re gonna have something that you\x92re gonna love more than any guy you\x92ve\never gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs\nyour finger. You have no idea.'"
Rachel:,b' Thanks sweetie.'
Ross:,"b' You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, I think I\x92m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, I thought I cheered you up.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh you did, there are twenty in here.'"
Ross:,b' Right. Good night.'
Rachel:,b' Good night.'
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Ross:,b' Oh hi!'
Ross:,b' Wow! Uh\x85how are you?'
Ross:,"b' Oh that\x92s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a\nUkrainian film?'"
Ross:,b' Great! Well umm\x85'
Ross:,"b' Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.'"
Chandler:,b' (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you\ndoing?!'
