Phoebe:,"b' Wow, it\x92s like a dirty math problem.'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.'
Joey:,"b' Well, that\x92s really a different question.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.'"
Rachel:,"b' Excuse me, there was no time!'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, but let\x92s say there was. How might that go?'"
Rachel:,b' Does anybody need more coffee?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ll take some.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, there\x92s a dog out there!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, that is so unfortunate.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.'
Phoebe:,b' You didn\x92t leave lipstick marks on the phone.'
Phoebe:,b' (angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That\x92s why I moved out.'
Ross:,"b"" Hey, y'know while we\x92re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister\nthat you don\x92t live here anymore."""
Phoebe:,b' I think on some levels she already knows.'
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, she doesn\x92t know that you sneak out every night, she\ndoesn\x92t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn\x92t know that\nyou\x92ve been living with your Grandmother\x92s for a week now.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, well maybe not on those levels.'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering, with a goatee) Hey.'"
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m never gonna find a roommate, ever.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Why, nobody good?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well let\x92s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that\x92s\nplural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need\nto make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing '"
Ross:,b' So how many more do you have tomorrow?'
Chandler:,"b' Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,\nwho I\x92m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone\n\x91Chandler Bing,\x92 he said \x91Whoa-whoa, short message.\x92'"
Ross:,"b' (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.'"
Ross:,"b' I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...'"
Chandler:,"b' Umm, how\x92s it going with you guys?'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were\nhaving so much trouble lately."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, really?'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn\x92t really have any\nclose friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan\nsomething, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it\x92s gonna make a difference"""
Chandler:,"b' Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless\nit turns out to be your sister, I think you\x92re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers\nto shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.\nLiving room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)\nBye-bye.'"
Joey:,"b' Don\x92t you ah, don\x92t you wanna ask me any questions?'"
Chandler:,b' Sure. Ummm. What\x92s up?'
Joey:,"b' Well, ah, I\x92m an actor. I\x92m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.\nOh, and don\x92t worry I\x92m totally okay with the gay thing.'"
Chandler:,b' What gay thing?'
Joey:,"b"" Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I\x92m totally cool\nwith that."""
Chandler:,"b' Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.'"
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, Mon.'"
Chandler:,b' Do I ever.'
Chandler:,b' No way!'
Chandler:,b' Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?'
Chandler:,b' (to bartender) Can I get a beer.'
Chandler:,b' You betcha!'
Chandler:,"b' Um-mm, yeah right!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh yes, and that\x92s what I want a roommate that I can walk around\nwith and be referred to as the funny one.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, but after that, we\x92re shootin\x92 some pool.'"
Rachel:,"b' (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no,\nno, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I\nordered a rum and '"
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a\ncouple drinks right, huh?'"
Rachel:,"b' Ummm, I think it\x92s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out\nand they all scream)'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I know.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I don\x92t know. Well maybe it\x92s just the idea of Barry for\nthe rest of my life. I don\x92t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,\ny'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)"""
Rachel:,"b"" I\x92m serious, I really, I think I need just to have\nsome...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see."""
Chandler:,"b' Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, so?'"
Chandler:,b' (picks it up) And now I\x92ve picked it up again. (walks over to\nMonica.)'
Rachel:,"b' Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)'"
Rachel:,"b' Yes, his name is Barry, he\x92s a doctor, thank you very much.'"
Rachel:,"b' Thank you. So how-how \x91bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, but that\x92s okay.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the\ncue ball as a \x91Remember me?\x92 thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next\ntime I\x92m in the city?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay!'
Rachel:,b' Bye!'
Ross:,"b' No real-, honey, really it\x92s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,\nno, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye'"
Phoebe:,b' So what are they doing?'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know, something girlie.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (to Monica, who\x92s entering) Hey, you\x92re early.'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m just taking it to be re-wired.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.'"
Phoebe:,b' You don\x92t play the oboe!'
Phoebe:,b' Then I\x92m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in\nhis face.)'
Joey:,b' Hey! (goes into the apartment)'
Chandler:,b' (leaving to go to work) Hey!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, don\x92t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I\ngotta get to get to work.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don\x92t!'"
Joey:,"b' Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s a uh, that\x92s a tough combination.'"
Joey:,b' Like you wouldn\x92t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is\na great place.'
Joey:,b' Gotcha.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, you bet I am!'"
Joey:,"b' You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa, ah!! We\x92re you just gonna give me some lemonade?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh right, right.'"
Joey:,"b' Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.\nWell, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I\x92m such a jerk.'"
Phoebe:,b' Huh?'
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a \x91Come on\x92\nlook) Oh no. I can\x92t believe this is happening again.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I\x92ve, I don\x92t live here\nanymore.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I\x92m sorry, I-I-I-I don\x92t live here anymore. I-I didn\x92t\nknow how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"""
Phoebe:,"b' That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,\nI, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn\x92t sleep for like a month because I got\nlike a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. '"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I would\x92ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other\nside.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, this is what I\x92m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a\nland where people can spill.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Aw, honey it\x92s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I\nlove you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don\x92t see that\nhappening."""
Phoebe:,"b' Aww, good. (they hug) What?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No you\x92re not, you\x92re wondering which cushion it is.'"
Chandler:,"b' So ah, whatcha watching?'"
Joey:,b' '
Chandler:,b' What\x92s it about?'
Joey:,b' Lifeguards.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who\x92s she?'"
Joey:,"b"" Nicole Eggert. You'll like her."""
Chandler:,b' Wow! Look at them run.'
Joey:,"b' They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ll go get one.'"
Joey:,"b' No, no, no, don\x92t get up, I got a cooler right here.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, hello!'"
Chandler:,b' Do you have any beers? We\x92re out of beers.'
Chandler:,b' You okay?'
Chandler:,b' Right.'
Chandler:,"b' Noo!! You don\x92t have a boyfriend because....I don\x92t, I\ndon\x92t know why you don\x92t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my\nfavourite people and the most beautiful woman I\x92ve ever known in real life.'"
Ross:,b' (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is\nwrong?'"
Ross:,"b' My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh no! Why?'
Ross:,"b' \x91Cause Carol\x92s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I\x92m\nnot one. And apparently it\x92s not a mix and match situation.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! I don\x92t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.'"
Ross:,"b"" (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many\ndrinks) I\x92m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I\x92d be out and\nshe\x92d, she\x92d see some beautiful woman, and, and she\x92d be Ross y'know look\nat her, and I\x92d think, God, my wife is cool!"""
Phoebe:,"b' Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, now I do!!'"
Phoebe:,b' I\x92m sorry.'
Ross:,"b' Seven years. I mean we\x92ve been together seven years, she\x92s the\nonly woman who\x92s ever loved me, and the only woman I\x92ve-I\x92ve ever....'"
Phoebe:,"b' Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)'"
Chandler:,"b' Umm, this is nice.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?'"
Chandler:,"b' Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle\na nuclear device.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,\nit\x92s, it\x92s gonna be....'"
Ross:,"b' Maybe this would\x92ve happened if I\x92d been more nurturing, or\nI\x92d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can\x92t believe this!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I know no, no, y'know you don\x92t deserve this, you don\x92t Ross.\nYou\x92re, you\x92re really, you\x92re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)"""

Phoebe:,b' And you\x92re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And\nyou\x92re kind (kisses him on the lips)'
Ross:,b' Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)'
Ross:,"b' Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.'"
Phoebe:,b' Huh?'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, it\x92s okay.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh. (they start kissing again)'
Ross:,"b' Wait, wait, wait.'"
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' My foot is stuck in the pocket.'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b' No, I can\x92t get it out.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, that\x92s not something a girl wants to hear.'"
Ross:,"b' No, come on don\x92t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!'"
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)'
Ross:,b' Oh well. It probably would\x92ve been the most constructive solution.'
Phoebe:,b' You have chalk on your face.'
Ross:,b' Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, Ross you\x92re right, I don\x92t know why I always thought this\nwas real grass.'"
Ross:,b' My wife\x92s a lesbian.'
Joey:,b' Cool!!'
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t believe you came back.'
Rachel:,"b' Don\x92t say anything. I don\x92t wanna speak, I don\x92t wanna\nthink. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'

Rachel:,"b' Um, (shyly) Barry.'"
