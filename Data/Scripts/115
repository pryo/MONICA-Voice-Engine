Phoebe:,b' Never mind. But it was going to be really good.'
Ross:,"b"" What's going on?"""
Chandler:,"b"" So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al\ncalls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."""
Chandler:,b' So.... I quit.'
Chandler:,b' Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!'
Chandler:,"b"" If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I\nactually do."""
Phoebe:,b' So was it a lot more money?'
Chandler:,"b"" It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in\nhis office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS."""
Rachel:,b' ... the WENUS?'
Chandler:,b' Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.'
Rachel:,b' (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.'

Chandler:,"b"" Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's\nan all-toast restaurant."""
Phoebe:,"b"" (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah! """
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who\ncan, you know, create the entire menu."""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."""

Ross:,"b' Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?'"
Joey:,"b"" How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."""
Ross:,"b"" OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"""
Chandler:,b' Who are you going out with?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, is this the bug lady?'"
Rachel:,"b' (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.'"
Ross:,"b"" Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the\nmuseum."""
Rachel:,b' So what are you guys going to do?'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her\nback to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."""

Joey:,"b"" I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm\nkeeping it down, y'know?"""
Rachel:,b' My God! What happened to you?'
Chandler:,"b' Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,\npersonality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) ""You\nare ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational\ncorporation.""'"

Rachel:,"b' (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,\nhey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split\nthis with you."""
Chandler:,b' (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...'
