Joey:,"b"" Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!"""
Rachel:,b' Wh-what?!'
Joey:,"b' I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for\nexcess anything in there.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll\nwork right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!"""
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' You wanna work on your interview skills?'
Rachel:,b' O-okay!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi."""
Rachel:,b' Hi. '
Phoebe:,"b' Very good handshake, good wrist action.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did\nI ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)'
Phoebe:,"b"" Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler."""
Joey:,"b"" That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see\nme! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before."""
Joey:,"b' Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. '"
Joey:,"b"" (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a\nwoman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)\n(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in\nRoss's building is flirting with me."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here\ngoes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does\na little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She\nsmiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)\nOkay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor\x85"""
Joey:,"b"" Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,\nI'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica\naway and makes a disgusted face.)"""
Ross:,b' Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?'
Joey:,b' This is your place?'
Ross:,"b"" Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can\npretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)"""
Joey:,"b"" But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)"""
Joey:,b' Ugh!!'
Joey:,"b"" I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.\n(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his\n'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on\nhis remote.)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause\nsome guy shot at a store clerk."""
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, then maybe I can come too!'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, you go. (They kiss.)'"
Phoebe:,"b"" 'Kay, bye!"""
Phoebe:,b' Oh God!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh I just miss him so much!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this\nlittle puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just """
Phoebe:,b' So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?'
Phoebe:,"b' Come on, seriously! When did it end?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was '"
Chandler:,"b"" (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back."""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh hey, how'd the interview go?"""
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!'"
Joey:,b' Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall\nright out of your chair?'
Rachel:,b' No!'
Chandler:,b' So what happened?'
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y\'know? I\neven made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah! If\nyou\'ve got enough life jackets!"" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not\namused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye\nand ugh!'"
Joey:,b' What happened?'
Rachel:,"b"" (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we\nwere shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me\x85 Y'know maybe he was going to open\nthe door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh\x85 (The flashback shows that she\nkissed him on the cheek.)"""
Joey:,b' You kissed him?!'
Rachel:,"b"" Well, I didn't know what else to do!"""
Chandler:,"b' Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.'"
Rachel:,b' Thanks Chandler.'

Joey:,"b"" I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?"""
Rachel:,"b"" What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?"""
Joey:,b' Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?'
Rachel:,"b' I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back\ny\'know of course, \'cause ""Let\'s bring the girl back who kisses everybody!""'"
Chandler:,"b' Come on, Rach.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just\nsleep with him?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Maybe. I-I don't know\x97Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!"""
Joey:,"b"" Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.\nCome on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's\nback!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you."""
Joey:,"b"" No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the\nwindow.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.\n(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)"""
Chandler:,"b' I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes\nsomething, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and\nkisses her.)'"
Joey:,b' Damnit!! Did you move?!'
Ross:,"b"" Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey\njust stares at him) I'm Ross."""
Joey:,b' (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which\nis answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or\nbabysitter by any chance a hot girl?'"
Joey:,b' Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole\nother corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Excuse me?'
Rachel:,"b"" (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going\non here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am """

Chandler:,"b' (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you\x85 (He gestures and spills\nsome of his coffee.)'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh we can't, we already have plans."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so\namazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie."""

Chandler:,"b"" No, you're the best."""
Joey:,"b"" (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?\n(Has a silly grin.)"""
Joey:,"b"" I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)\nYeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her\nanyway."""

Rachel:,"b' Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.'"
Rachel:,"b' (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to\nstart by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She\nputs her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put\nher hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big\nmistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.\nWhen I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.\nAnd, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes\nthat she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you\ngotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in\nthe workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to\nlitigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.\xa0 So she didn't want to sue him.\n\xa0 Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts\nthem off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and\nnot litigious.

Rachel:,b' (gasps) Oh! You are?'
Rachel:,"b' Really? Oh thank you! Oh\x85 Oh, would it be completely inappropriate\nto give you a hug?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but\nmisses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to\ntouch that\x97I mean """
Phoebe:,b' You tired Chandler?'
Chandler:,"b' Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the\nlining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.\n(Heads for the bathroom.)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.'"
Phoebe:,b' We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!'
Chandler:,"b"" Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?"""
Chandler:,"b"" No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is\ngetting ridiculous!"""

Chandler:,b' (gasps) So?'
Chandler:,b' Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?'
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,\nI'm more excited about where we are right now."""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long\nbefore. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I\nthink that's pretty incredible.

Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our\nrelationship."""
Chandler:,b' Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!'
Chandler:,b' Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have\nswitched places! '
