Joey:,b' (from bedroom) WHOAA!!'
Chandler:,"b"" (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not\nto jump on the bed."""
Ross:,"b"" Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?"""
Rachel:,"b"" I didn't know there were docks."""
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,"b' Aww, is it broken?'"
Joey:,"b' No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is\nwearing)'"
Rachel:,b' Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?'
Joey:,b' Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.'
Chandler:,"b"" Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it\njust *fell* out of the socket."""
Joey:,b' What is this? Fruit?'
Rachel:,"b"" Monica's making jam."""
Joey:,"b' Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at\nour place?'"
Chandler:,b' Because the kids need new shoes.'
Joey:,b' This will just be my batch.'
Phoebe:,"b"" (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have\nyou been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."""
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, you're not a dingus."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is\njust what, what she does to guys, okay."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in\nJunior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was\nthis guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He\nsaid okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice\nguy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't\nhave to walk behind me any more."""
Rachel:,b' Mon?'
Ross:,b' Mon?'
Rachel:,"b"" (reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'"""
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, look.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b' Look, look, look.'"
Rachel:,"b' What, what, what?'"
Ross:,"b"" It's an empty apartment."""
Rachel:,b' Oooh.'
Ross:,"b"" We're all alone in an empty apartment."""
Rachel:,"b"" Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts\nkissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.\n(they fall onto the couch)"""
Ross:,b' There it is.'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey."""
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Do I look fat?'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that\nto mean that I was calling her a cow. '"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at\nher...."""
Ross:,"b"" Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's\njust a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?"""
Rachel:,b' Nooo!'
Ross:,b' And it works both ways.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, so you both just know this stuff?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.'"
Ross:,"b"" Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she\ngives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2\nis you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?"""
Chandler:,"b"" That's easy, baggage claim."""
Ross:,"b"" (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number\nthree, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her."""
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice\nlikes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to\ngo to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,\naccidentally calling her fat or something."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily\nsleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work."""
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Rachel:,b' All right are you guys gonna come down?'
Ross:,"b"" Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you."""
Rachel:,b' Good luck Chandler.'
Chandler:,b' Thank you Rachel.'
Ross:,b' Bye sweetie.'
Rachel:,b' Bye hon.'
Ross:,"b' (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but\nthere is something you can do.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.'"
Ross:,"b"" Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.\nOkay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and\nthigh.) Okay, you're in bed..."""
Chandler:,b' Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)'
Ross:,"b"" I'm gonna use the cushion."""
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b"" Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for\nher to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back\nover to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you."""
Chandler:,"b' Okay, the old hug and roll.'"
Ross:,b' Yep.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, one question.'"
Ross:,b' Shoot.'
Chandler:,"b"" You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?"""
Joey:,b' Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the\nmovies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?'
Rachel:,"b"" (Looks at him) You're so pretty."""
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him\ntoday."""
Joey:,b' (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his\nname is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was\nUrsula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause\nof the restraining order."""
Chandler:,"b"" Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this\nvery passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you\nknow. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."""
Phoebe:,"b"" No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you\nknow, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."""
Joey:,"b"" (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with\ncrumbs) """
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.'"
Joey:,b' Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds\nup one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)'"
Joey:,b' Put your hands together.'
Joey:,b' No more jam?!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, what happened to your jam plan?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.'"
Ross:,b' What are you talking about?'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Are you serious?'
Ross:,"b"" Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that\nguy's name? Dad!"""
Chandler:,"b"" That, that's what's stupid."""
Rachel:,b' Down at the docks again?'
Chandler:,b' Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self)'
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going\nstrong. Keep going."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Um, not even a little bit.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay then.'"
Phoebe:,b' Good. So what were you thinking?'
Phoebe:,b' Really?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay. (he kisses her)'"
Chandler:,"b"" No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard."""
Chandler:,"b"" You mean there's more than one of us."""
Ross:,"b"" Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,\nI'm, I'm gonna....."""
Ross:,"b"" I'm gonna tell Mom."""
Rachel:,"b"" Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy."""
Ross:,b' Crazy.'
Ross:,"b"" (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way..."""
Joey:,b' Check it out!! Jam crackers!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, the Knicks rule!'"
Joey:,"b' Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.'"
Rachel:,b' When did you go to a sperm bank?'
Joey:,"b' Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,\nRemember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?'"
Chandler:,"b"" And that's how you bought it?"""
Joey:,"b"" Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised\nthere's any of my boys left."""
Joey:,"b"" Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'\non here. You know, juice this puppy up a little."""
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hellooo!'
Ross:,"b"" How's the maniac?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'."""
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, what are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He\nquit for me."""
Rachel:,"b"" Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how\nlong, okay, you don't just give up something like that."""
Phoebe:,"b' Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.'"
Ross:,"b"" You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following\nher?"""
Chandler:,"b' Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.'"
Phoebe:,b' What are you saying I should do?'
Phoebe:,"b' Thank you, Monica.'"
Joey:,"b' Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)"""
Rachel:,b' Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.'
Rachel:,"b"" (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?"""
Phoebe:,b' Yes? Yes! Oh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich.\nOh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you\nwere still hung up on my sister."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just\nwalkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you\nknow she takes this train?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I\nmade you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause\nyour, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely\nhelp you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be\nlike an Ursula patch."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the\npillar, which way am I gonna go? """
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Where you going?'
Joey:,b' Sperm or regular?'
Joey:,"b"" So you're really doing this, huh?"""
Joey:,b' Sounds nice.'
Joey:,"b"" No kiddin', hmm. """
Joey:,"b"" No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."""
Joey:,"b"" I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,\nsmart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."""
Joey:,"b"" It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big\npool."""
Joey:,"b"" He's got the body for it."""
Joey:,"b"" You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet,\nso don't pee in our pool.', you know."""
Joey:,"b' Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great\nkids.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good\ntoo. '"
Joey:,"b"" Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops\nhugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for\nlike a day. (hugs her again)."""
Joey:,"b"" I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of\nTribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of\nthe jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if\nthey met me in person."""
Rachel:,"b' Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)'"
Joey:,b' (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' (entering) Hello. '
Rachel:,b' Hello.'
Ross:,"b' (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I\ntalk to you for a second?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Sure. What's up?"""
Ross:,"b' Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your\nalready familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)'"
