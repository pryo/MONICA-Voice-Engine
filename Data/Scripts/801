Ross:,"b' (To Monica) Okay, I know I\x92m not supposed to know, but I do. And\nI\x92m so excited for you!'"
Joey:,b' What? What\x92s going on?'
Ross:,b' Monica\x92s pregnant!'
Joey:,b' Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!'
Joey:,b' Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)'
Ross:,b' What?! What do you mean? You-you-you\x92re not pregnant?'
Ross:,b' No! (Pause) I\x92ll be right back. (Exits.)'
Joey:,b' I can\x92t! I-I don\x92t have any other clothes here.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey\nMon, why did you tell the guys you weren\x92t pregnant?'"
Phoebe:,"b' We found your test in the trash, if you\x92re not pregnant\x97(She\nsees Rachel shaking her head)\x97It\x92s because I am.'"
Chandler:,b' What?! What are you talking about?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, I\x85I am with child. (Flash) And I didn\x92t want to say\nanything because it\x92s your day; I didn\x92t want to steal your thunder.'"
Chandler:,b' Who\x92s the father?'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t say.'
Chandler:,b' Why not?'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t say because he\x92s famous.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, okay. It\x92s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my\nbaby.'"
Chandler:,b' As in Barbara Streisand\x92s husband James Brolin?'
Phoebe:,b' What?! Well he never said that to me!'
Phoebe:,b' How about just the bridemaids?'
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.'
Phoebe:,b' It is.'
Rachel:,b' For you. (Chandler leaves.)'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can\x92t deal with this just\nquite yet.'"
Phoebe:,b' So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.'
Rachel:,"b' You said that she was, I just didn\x92t disagree with you.'"
Phoebe:,b' Sneaky.'
Rachel:,b' Oh yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-hmm.'
Rachel:,b' James Brolin?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and\nthen I remembered he\x92s gay.'"
Rachel:,b' Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.'
Phoebe:,b' (intrigued) Really?!'
Chandler:,b' Before we go out there I\x92ve got a present for ya.'
Chandler:,b' No?'
Chandler:,b' I\x92ve been taking dancing lessons.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never\nforget.'"
Chandler:,b' So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?'
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know, it\x92s these new shoes, they\x92re all\nslippery.'"
Chandler:,b' Not well.'
Phoebe:,"b' So, are you ready to talk about it?'"
Rachel:,b' No.'
Phoebe:,b' Now?'
Rachel:,b' No!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, we\x92ll talk about something else then.'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Phoebe:,b' Who\x92s the father?!'
Rachel:,"b' Ugh! Look honey y\x92know what? I haven\x92t told him yet, so until\nI do I don\x92t think I should tell anybody else.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah. That\x92s fine. That\x92s fair. Is it Tag?'
Rachel:,b' Phoebe!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I\x92m sorry. I\x92ll stop.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' Is it Ross? It\x92s Ross isn\x92t it\x97Oh my God, it\x92s Joey!'"
Rachel:,"b' Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.'"
Phoebe:,b' Ah-hah! At least we know it\x92s a him.'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it\x92s either\nthis or a bathrobe! Look, what\x92s more important, the way I\x92m dressed or me being\nwith you on your special day?'"
Ross:,"b' Hi. I\x92m uh, I\x92m Ross. I don\x92t, I don\x92t believe\nwe\x92ve met. I\x92m Monica\x92s older brother.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those\nwords.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.'"
Ross:,"b' Aw come on, Mona Lisa?'"
Ross:,"b' Mona umm\x85Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she\x92s\nuh\x97well she\x92s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the\nplant world.'"
Ross:,"b' Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She\nshows him.) Oh, uh me too.'"
Ross:,"b' (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same\ntable.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you\x92ve just been bumped up to table one. And if\nit\x92s all right with you I\x92m gonna take your place at table six\x97Martin\nClickclocken.'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go.\nOkay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They\ndo a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)'"
Chandler:,b' Thank you.'
Chandler:,b' Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t believe we\x92ve met, Joey Tribbiani.'"
Joey:,"b' Wow, I\x92ve admired your work for years. You-you\x92ve done some\nreally amazing stuff.'"
Joey:,b' Wow Dennis Phillips! That\x92s great! How did you guys meet?'
Chandler:,b' Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)'
Ross:,"b' Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way\n(he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I\x92m\x85 (He\ngoes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.'"
Joey:,"b' Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?\n\x91Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would\x92ve done it all, film,\ntelevision, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that\x92s just for ugly\npeople.'"
Chandler:,b' What size shoes do you wear?'
Joey:,"b' Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.'"
Chandler:,"b' Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance\nfloor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, I don\x92t even really know where I left those. Sorry.'"
Chandler:,b' (looking at Joey\x92s feet) Those aren\x92t eleven and a half.'
Joey:,"b' Okay fine! I\x92m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet.\nBut the rest of me is good, I\x92ll show ya!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh y\x92know what honey? Let\x92s not talk about that right now?'
Rachel:,"b' Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey! Y\x92know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can\nwear everything they\x92re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets\nthrough!'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know! Maybe they have tools.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, maybe that\x92s, maybe that\x92s really brave.'"
Rachel:,b' Maybe she hasn\x92t really thought it through that well.'
Rachel:,b' (starting to cry) I don\x92t know.'
Rachel:,b' Uh-hmm. I\x92m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and\nrealizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass\nwithout Monica noticing. It doesn\x92t work.) Oh that\x92s-that\x92s actually how\nthe French drink it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would\nleave her for me. And I said, ""James, James Brolin, are you sure?"" James Brolin\nsaid\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know. I don\x92t know how I feel. This is all happening\nso fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don\x92t want to make. (Takes another\nsip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!'
Phoebe:,b' Calm down. Maybe you\x92re not pregnant.'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times\njust to make sure.'"
Rachel:,b' How many ways are there to do that?'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m-I\x92m just saying, don\x92t freak out until you\x92re a\nhundred percent sure.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, I\x92ll-I\x92ll take it again when I get home.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. Thank you.'
Phoebe:,b' I\x92ll run out and get you one.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you guys are so great.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no, she won\x92t tell us.'"
Rachel:,"b' Wh\x97Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.'"
Phoebe:,b' See? This is why you register.'
Ross:,"b' It was the chair again! Okay? I\x92m not doing it! It what\x97look, I\ndon\x92t\x97y\x92know what\x97eh-eh\x85 (He walks away and goes over to Mona.)\nHi.'"
Ross:,"b' Umm, would you like to dance?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Ross:,b' Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)'
Ross:,"b' I wasn\x92t farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the\nlittle girl) Yes?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I\x92m about to dance\nwith this lady. '"
Ross:,"b' Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn\x92t mind letting you go first.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don\x92t we try it my special way? You\ncan dance on my feet.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady\nlooking?'
Ross:,b' Keep dancing.'
Chandler:,b' And the world will never know.'
Joey:,b' Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about '"
Joey:,b' No-no! No! No! You don\x92t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks\nI\x92m a soap actor.'
Chandler:,b' But you\x92re '
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' No-no, thank you Miranda.'"
Ross:,b' All right. (Walks over to Mona.)'
Ross:,"b' Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?'"
Ross:,b' What? Of course you can! Hop on!'
Ross:,b' I am so gonna score.'
Ross:,b' I like your bow.'
Joey:,"b' (clinks his glass) I\x92d like to propose a toast. To Monica and\nChandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first\nfound out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly\nangry) ""Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!"" But then I thought\nback over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and\nthere was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I\x92m sorry. And-and some\nscared memories\x97Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized\nI\x92ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has\ntraining in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but\nrealizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!'"
Ross:,b' (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.'
Ross:,b' No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.) '
Ross:,b' Oh! (Recoils in horror.)'
Ross:,"b' Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what\x92s\nuh, what\x92s your name.'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s, that\x92s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to\nstep on Ross\x92s feet, but he pulls them out of harm\x92s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\nWhat are you doing there Gert?'"
Ross:,b' Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)'
Ross:,b' I\x92m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)'
Ross:,b' Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert\x92s shocked and Ross realizes\nwhat he said and tries to brush it off.)'
Joey:,"b' So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, I\x92d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I\nknow you\x92re casting for this new show\x85'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, see that\x92s where you\x92re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it.\nAnd if didn\x92t see it up there, just-just try me.'"
Joey:,"b' Well I\x92m not proud of this, but\x85 (He turns around and starts to\nmess with his eyelids.)'"
Chandler:,b' Did it turn into sand?'
Chandler:,"b' (sliding up behind her) No. No, I won\x92t. Do you know why I took\nall those lessons? See, for the first time I didn\x92t want you to be embarrassed to be\nseen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.'"
Chandler:,b' Why?'
Rachel:,b' How much longer?'
Phoebe:,b' 30 seconds.'
Rachel:,"b' 30 seconds, okay.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)'
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s time.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh wait! Y\x92know what? I can\x92t, I can\x92t look at it. I\ncan\x92t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, it\x92s negative.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s negative.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is\x97that\x92s\ngreat\x97that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y\x92know \x91cause the whole not\nbeing ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way\nit was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.'"
Phoebe:,b' Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)'
Rachel:,b' Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset\nover something I never had? It\x92s negative?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, it\x92s positive.'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' It\x92s-it\x92s not negative, it\x92s positive.'"
Rachel:,b' Are you sure?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well yeah, I lied before.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Phoebe:,b' Now you know how you really feel about it.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh-oh, that\x92s a risky little game!'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah. I\x92m gonna have a baby. I\x92m gonna have a baby. I\x92m\ngonna have a baby! (They all hug.)'
Phoebe:,b' With who?'
Rachel:,"b' Ah, it\x92s still not the time.'"
Ross:,b' I just didn\x92t see the fast song coming.'
Joey:,"b' Shh. Shh. Don\x92t try to talk, we\x92ll get you up to your room,\nwe\x92ll soak your feet, you\x92ll be okay.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, thank you.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Tell me about it, I feel like I\x92m holding down the fort all by\nmyself.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' Wait a minute! No! I\x92m the nice one! I\x92m the one who danced with\nthe kids all night! How\x85How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)'
