Rachel:,"b' So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?'"
Rachel:,b' And?'
Rachel:,b' Look at that!'
Ross:,b' How weird is that? Y\x92know? You\x92re moving in with me and have the\n'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,"b' (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ross, I know what you\x92re thinking.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' That she\x92s gonna move in with you and maybe then she\x92ll fall\nin love with you and then when she finds out you\x92re already married, she\x92ll just\nbe happy. Y\x92know? You\x92re just, you\x92re very sad.'"
Ross:,b' Oh\x85my\x85God! I-I see what this is! '
Phoebe:,b' What?!!'
Ross:,"b' Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you\x92re obsessed with her.\nIt\x92s always, ""Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?"" ""Ross,\nwhy-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you gonna confess your secret\nmarriage to Rachel?"" You want her!'"
Phoebe:,b' No! (Ross\x92s phone rings.)'
Ross:,"b' (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?'"
Rachel:,"b' No-no, I bought those.'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)'
Ross:,"b' (on phone) No-no-no, that\x92s great! I\x92ll be there Monday. And\nthank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, '"
Ross:,"b' Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate,\nhuh? They loved it. '"
Rachel:,"b' Well, who wouldn\x92t?!'"
Ross:,"b' I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it\x92s\ntemporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that\nlook great on a mailbox, huh? ""Professor Geller.""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, Professor and Mrs.'"
Rachel:,b' And Mrs.?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! Yeah, y\x92know you and Ross are still married.'"
Rachel:,b' What?!!'
Phoebe:,b' Just kidding!'
Rachel:,b' Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.) '
Phoebe:,b' (To Ross) Saved your ass.'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, what\x92s the matter?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, you know that psychic I see?'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, she told me that I\x92m gonna die this week, so I\x92m kinda\nbummed about that.'"
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, and I know you guys don\x92t know a lot about psychic readings,\nbut that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.'"
Joey:,b' I can\x92t believe she would say that too you.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah honey you don\x92t believe her do you?'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t\x97she said y\x92know that I\x92d have triplets! But\nshe also said one of them would be black.'
Chandler:,b' Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you\x92re gonna go?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, \x91cause she didn\x92t tell me I was gonna die until the very\nend of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I\x92ve\nonly got a week left, y\x92know? I\x92ve '"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey everyone!'
Chandler:,b' Oh hi!'
Ross:,"b' Hey uh, well, today\x92s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it\nout on you guys, do you, do you mind?'"
Ross:,"b' (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)\n""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these\ntheories can be further subcategorized into two distinct\x85""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, this is it. This what\x92s gonna kill me.'"
Ross:,"b' (continuing) ""\x85subcategories. The first of these subcategories\nis\x85""'"
Joey:,"b' (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that\npiece of paper?'"
Ross:,b' No! Why?'
Joey:,"b' Well, I\x92ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper\nthat didn\x92t have naked chicks on it.'"
Ross:,"b' Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) ""There\nare three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.\n(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of\nthese theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)\ninto\x85""'"
Chandler:,b' Why don\x92t you open with a joke?'
Ross:,"b' Open with a joke? It\x92s a university, not a comedy club!'"
Chandler:,"b' Wait a minute, hold the phone! You\x92re '"
Ross:,b' (gets up) Okay!'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?'"
Ross:,b' Thank you!'
Rachel:,"b' Some uh, some visual aides.'"
Joey:,b' Oh-ooh-ooh! Y\x92know what\x92s a good visual aide?'
Ross:,b' Please don\x92t say naked chicks.'
Joey:,b' Why not?!'
Ross:,b' I-I-I don\x92t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.\nY\x92know what? I\x92m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s the way I did it \x91til I was 19.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hey! Any good mail?'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor\x92s Guild.'"
Joey:,"b' Ooh, it\x92s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,\nI\x92m kinda\x85.'"
Chandler:,"b' (opens and reads it) ""Benefits lapsed.""'"
Joey:,b' Hmm that\x92s weird. I don\x92t remember being in a move called\nbenefits lapsed.'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, it\x92s not a check. They\x92re saying your health insurance\nexpired because, you didn\x92t work enough last year.'"
Joey:,b' Let me see that!'
Chandler:,b' All right.'
Joey:,"b' (reads it) Oh, I can\x92t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance\nI could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y\x92know? And it wouldn\x92t matter. Now I\ngotta be careful?!'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sorry man, there\x92s never a good time to (pauses) stop\ncatching on fire.'"
Joey:,"b' All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I\x92m gonna go see my\nagent.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.'"
Joey:,"b' (mocks him, in a whiney voice) \x85look both ways before you cross the\nstreet. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey Pheebs, you\x92re still alive! How are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ugh, it\x92s '"
Rachel:,"b' Pheebs, what-what are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,b' I was preparing you for my\x97didn\x92t you think I was dead? Did\nthat not come off?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we\x92d lost you\nforever. Pheebs, you lie down?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,\nwake me up in a couple hours, y\x92know if you can.'"
Rachel:,b' Monica!'
Rachel:,b' Did-did you take these back?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh yeah, they\x92re really great! Aren\x92t they?'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)'
Ross:,b' (entering) Hello!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' It went great! And I didn\x92t need any jokes or naked chicks either!'
Rachel:,"b' Wow, that\x92s great Ross, I\x92m sorry we weren\x92t more\nsupportive before.'"
Ross:,"b' I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.\nEveryone\x92s all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well, I proved them\nwrong! And now, I\x92m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s right!'
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey Estelle, listen\x85'"
Joey:,b' What are you talkin\x92 about? I never left you! You\x92ve always been\nmy agent!'
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Joey:,"b' Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.'"
Joey:,b' Why?'
Joey:,b' Bastard!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me\ntomorrow and I\x92ll have my health insurance back in no time.'
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s great, but shouldn\x92t you be on the toilet right now?'"
Joey:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,b' What\x92s wrong with you?'
Joey:,"b' Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting\nweights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven\x92t been able to stand up since. But\num, I don\x92t think it\x92s anything serious.'"
Chandler:,b' This sounds like a hernia. You have to\x97you-you go to the doctor!'
Joey:,"b' No way! \x91Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything\nit\x92s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows\nChandler.)'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s a hernia.'
Joey:,b' Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was\nusing.) Damn you 15s!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, we\x92re a little early, the lecture doesn\x92t end for 15\nminutes.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There\x92s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was\na Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.'"
Ross:,"b' (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the\nlaboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact\nsedimentary. Imagine his consternation when\x97(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.'"
Ross:,"b' Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!\nI got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British\naccent just came out.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, and not a very good one.'"
Ross:,b' Will you-will you please?'
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Ross:,"b' (in his British accent) I\x92m sorry, I\x92ve got plans with my\nsister.'"
Ross:,"b' (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica\naside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?'"
Ross:,b' Just please stop!'
Rachel:,"b' (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)\nSit down! Will you '"
Joey:,"b' Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it\x92s\ngetting darker and more painful, that means it\x92s healing.'"
Chandler:,b' I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let\x92s just\nget that thing\x85pushed back in.'
Joey:,"b' Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I\ndon\x92t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in\nI can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I\x92m thinking I\x92ll probably start\nwith that laser eye surgery too.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s going on?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh Joey\x92s got a really bad hernia, but that\x92s nothing a\nlittle laser eye surgery won\x92t fix!'"
Joey:,"b' Look, I\x92m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He\nputs his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on '"
Phoebe:,b' Hey! Maybe you\x92ll die!'
Joey:,"b' Sure, now I\x92m scared.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, we can go together! Just don\x92t wait too long though, okay?\n\x91Cause I\x92m outta here sometime before Friday.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, but I don\x92t wanna die!'"
Phoebe:,"b' No-no, it\x92ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!'"
Rachel:,b' No! They are mine!'
Rachel:,b' You stole them from me!!'
Rachel:,b' Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.'
Ross:,"b' (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to\nspeak in a British accent?! What do I do?'"
Rachel:,b' Well\x85'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they\x92re\nprobably not even listening!'"
Ross:,b' They\x92re not listening too me?'
Rachel:,b' Of course they\x92re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.'
Ross:,b' Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?'
Joey:,"b' (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. ""Hey, Timmy, I\x92ve got a\nsurprise for you.""'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I\x92ll just\x97hold on one second. (He\nturns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)\n""Hey Timmy, I\x92ve got a surprise for you!""'"
Joey:,b' So that\x92s why I feed my dog '
Joey:,b' Exactly.'
Joey:,"b' Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, '"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, okay. (Leaves)'"
Joey:,b' Hi. I\x92m Joey Tribbiani; I\x92m here to audition for (Groans) man.'
Joey:,b' Yes!'
Rachel:,b' Really? Really?!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent)\n""Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we\x92d like you\nto come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I\x92m not going die!'"
Rachel:,b' Really?! How do you know?'
Phoebe:,b' Because my psychic is dead! She must\x92ve read the cards wrong!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Eh, better her than me! Hey, let\x92s bake cookies!'"
Chandler:,"b' Listen, I\x92m really glad you got the part.'"
Joey:,b' (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.'
Chandler:,b' But are you sure you can do this?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me\ntake a shower.'"
Chandler:,"b' Now, is '"
Joey:,b' (to the director) Hiya!'
Joey:,"b' Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my\npants. (Holds them both up.)'"
Joey:,"b' ""Take could care of your Momma son."" (Alex just looks at him and\nthe director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) ""Take could care of\nyour Momma son."" (Alex does nothing.) ""Come on son! Your Momma\x92s good\npeople!""'"
Joey:,"b' Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right\nup until you say action?'"
Joey:,b' Okay. (Starts screaming.)'
Joey:,"b' (he stops screaming at action) ""Take good care of your Momma\nson."" (Again Alex does nothing.)'"
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don\x92t you uh, lift up your\nshirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex '"
Rachel:,b' (answering it) Hello? '
Rachel:,"b' Uh no, he\x92s not. Can I take a message?'"
Rachel:,b' Ross got married again\x97Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!'
Ross:,b' (in his head) '
Ross:,"b' (British) Come again? What\x92s-what\x92s this nonsense? (Giggles.)\n(American.) All right, I\x92m-I\x92m not English. I\x92m from Long Island. I was\nreally nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I\x92m sorry. So, if we could just\nget back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands)\nAbout paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to\nmake a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is\nreally important because I\x92m-I\x92m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you\njust give me another chance to make a good impression\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am '
Ross:,"b' (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!'"
Phoebe:,b' Have you really done this before?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don\x92t hold\nback. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden\nbaseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey-hey-hey!'
Chandler:,b' What are you doing?'
Phoebe:,b' We\x92re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, all right.'"
