Chandler:,b' Yes! Well that-yes.'
Joey:,b' Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?'
Chandler:,b' We actually missed it.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, maybe you wouldn\x92t have had you (turns to the attendant) '"
Phoebe:,"b' What\x92s the big deal, y\x92know? It\x92s not like it\x92s a\nreal marriage.'"
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you\x92re only married in Vegas.'"
Phoebe:,b' (shocked) Really?! '
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!\x97Eh! Well\x85'
Rachel:,b' Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and\ngroans.)'
Ross:,b' Why are we in bed together?'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?'
Ross:,b' (checks) Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Really?!'
Ross:,"b' No! But we-we didn\x92t have\x85sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don\x92t\nremember much about last night, it was such a blur.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.'
Ross:,b' And we didn\x92t have sex. '
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I\x92m just glad we didn\x92t do\nanything stupid.'"
Ross:,"b' (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has\n""Just Married"" written on his back.)'"
Joey:,"b' Mornin\x92 Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been\ncanceled.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh Joey, I\x92m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?'"
Joey:,"b' Nah, I\x92m too depressed to eat. I\x92ll probably eat in like 5\nminutes. So I guess I\x92ll just fly home with you guys, what time\x92s your flight?'"
Phoebe:,b' What about my cab?'
Joey:,b' I don\x92t need that anymore.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.'"
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.\n(Gets an idea.) Oh\x97ooh! How about you come with me?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I don\x92t know, it\x92s such a long trip.'"
Joey:,"b' It\x92ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be\nour chance to like renew our friendship.'"
Phoebe:,b' Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?'
Joey:,b' Sure?'
Phoebe:,"b' All right. Although I don\x92t think we need one, I never stopped\nloving you.'"
Chandler:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.'"
Joey:,b' Where is the waitress?! I\x92m starving!'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s a buffet man.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, here\x92s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the\nbuffet table with Chandler in tow.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Listen, I gotta talk to you.'"
Joey:,b' Sure! What\x92s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a\nhuge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a\nspoonful.)'
Chandler:,b' Monica and I almost got married last night.'
Joey:,"b' Oh my God! That\x92s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I\nwasn\x92t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don\x92t say,\n""Ross."" Do '"
Chandler:,"b' Look, I just don\x92t think Monica and I are ready to get married\nyet! Y\x92know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out\nof that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.\nY\x92know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?'"
Joey:,b' Oh! Tell her she\x92s not marriage material.'
Chandler:,b' What?!'
Joey:,"b' Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she\x92s anything\nlike me, she\x92s just gonna be relieved.'"
Phoebe:,b' Well you don\x92t.'
Phoebe:,b' Good! Good! I was just testing you.'
Chandler:,b' (returning with Joey) Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. '"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or\x85'
Rachel:,"b' (To Ross) I don\x92t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?\nNothing, nothing uh, happened last night.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.'
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)'
Chandler:,b' (not quite sure) You did.'
Ross:,b' What?! Hello! We didn\x92t get married.'
Rachel:,"b' No, we didn\x92t get married! That\x92s ridiculous!'"
Ross:,b' We-we-we\x97I remember being in a chapel.'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God.'
Ross:,b' I\x97They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!'
Rachel:,b' No!'
Joey:,b' They let you get married when you\x92re drunk! Most people who get\nmarried in Vegas '
Phoebe:,"b' Hell, I\x92m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I\ncan\x92t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I\x92m on vacation!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one\x92s\nfree, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one\x92s free.'"
Ross:,"b' Laugh it up, but the joke\x92s on you. Because we don\x92t need to get\ndivorced, okay? We we\x92re just gonna get an annulment. '"
Joey:,b' An annulment? Ross! I don\x92t think surgery\x92s the answer here.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh-oh, that\x92s your thing.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re thing. You\x92re thing. Y\x92know? You\x92re the guy\nwho gets divorced.'
Ross:,"b' No-no, that\x92s-that\x92s not my thing! I do not love getting\ndivorced!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much\nyou\x92re probably gonna marry it! Then it won\x92t work out and you\x92re gonna\nhave to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I\x92m so drunk.'"
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t know. But I-I-I know I love you!'
Chandler:,b' So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have\nall the marriages thing? I love you.'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, we don\x92t get married unless there\x92s a sign! Okay, so\nsay uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there\x92s a '"
Chandler:,b' Sounds great.'
Chandler:,b' Ready!'
Chandler:,"b' (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.'"
Chandler:,b' That was '
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah. (They go pack.) We\x92re doing the right thing, right?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come\non Joey! You can\x92t win if you don\x92t ask any (sees that he\x92s asleep) '"
Joey:,b' (wakes up) What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We\x92ve been on the road six\nhours and you\x92ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest\nstop and '"
Joey:,b' All right. All right.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the\nradio\x92s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.'
Joey:,b' Really? I don\x92t\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Sing!!'
Joey:,b' (starts singing) '
Joey:,"b' (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens\nhis eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)'"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, hubby!'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole\nannulment thing?'"
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Ross:,b' I\x92m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)'
Rachel:,"b' Okay! So, we\x92ll just stay married.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, exactly!'"
Rachel:,b' And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!'
Ross:,"b' Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I\x92d have to talk you\ninto this more.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, see now I\x92m scared because I don\x92t actually think\nyou\x92re kidding.'"
Ross:,"b' I\x92m-I\x92m not kidding. Look I-I, I can\x92t have '"
Rachel:,b' What-wh-what so we\x92ll just stay married forever?!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some\nform out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box\nthat says Mrs.! It\x92s '"
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, okay, I\x92m sorry. You\x92re right. Y\x92know what? We\nabsolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far '"
Ross:,b' I\x92m asking you to do me a favor. '
Rachel:,b' You are asking me to be your wife!'
Ross:,b' And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.'
Chandler:,b' Well you did pull his hair.'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m not getting into this again!'
Chandler:,"b'\xa0 Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.\n(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of\nMonica who is only holding on by his neck.)'"
Chandler:,b' No!'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a\nrape\x97(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker\x92s face), a rapist or a\nkiller or something!'"
Joey:,b' Don\x92t you think I asked him that before he got in?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know what? I\x92m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To\nthe hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!'"
Phoebe:,b' Do you like car games?'
Phoebe:,b' I '
Joey:,"b' Ooh, I\x92ll play! I\x92ll play!'"
Phoebe:,b' No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the\npartition.) '
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make\nyou want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and '"
Rachel:,"b' (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I\nthought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay\nmarried.'"
Ross:,b' I don\x92t know if it\x92s true.'
Rachel:,b' Oh b-b-but it is!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, okay, y\x92know what this is? '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the\nworld\x92s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if '"
Ross:,"b' All right. All right, I\x92ll do it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any\nsuch thing as an annulment shower?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay.'"
Phoebe:,"b' And I have your name and the fact that you\x92re a drifter, so the\nball\x92s pretty much in your court.'"
Joey:,b' Come on Pheebs! I can\x92t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to\nyou. Huh? (Starts singing.) '
Phoebe:,b' Stop it! Stop it no! That\x92s not fair! Y\x92know I can\x92t\nresist that beautiful voice!'
Joey:,"b' Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your\nfriend and I didn\x92t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an\nimportant part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I\nknow you.'"
Phoebe:,b' You can still sleep at night and stuff.'
Joey:,"b' Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I\x92ve got a really\ngood one! I\x92ve been thinking about it since Kansas.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?'
Joey:,b' Yes.'
Phoebe:,b' Is it a meatball sub?'
Joey:,b' That is incredible! You are the master!'
Rachel:,"b' Huh, that\x92s funny. You look like you\x92re gonna be the\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y\x92know? I\nmean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.'"
Chandler:,b' Me too!'
Chandler:,b' No!'
Chandler:,"b' Jeez, relax! It\x92s not like we\x92re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering, slowly) Y\x92know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack\nhere?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, what if all my stuff was here?'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I\x92m\nsaying?'
Chandler:,b' Me asking is kind of a sign.'
Chandler:,b' Okay!!!!!'
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,b' Oh thanks.'
Chandler:,"b' The door hasn\x92t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.)\nReady?!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can\x92t get\nin!'"
Chandler:,b' This is not a sign!'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s an old key!'
Chandler:,b' I love you!'
Chandler:,b' Are you hugging the door right now.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah-yeah, me neither.'"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, yeah, no problems. It\x92s all taken care of.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah, why not?'"
Rachel:,b' Pheebs?'
Phoebe:,"b' No thanks, I\x92ve already seen one.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, umm, I\x92m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)'"
Ross:,"b' Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?'"
Phoebe:,b' Always.'
Ross:,b' I didn\x92t get the annulment.'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' We\x92re still married! Don\x92t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets\nup leaving Phoebe in shock.)'
Joey:,b' What are you doing?'
Chandler:,b' The key\x92s stuck in the lock.'
Joey:,b' I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)\nLook out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)'
Chandler:,b' (trying the handle) It still doesn\x92t work.'
Joey:,b' I\x92m not finished.'
Chandler:,b' Oh.'
Chandler:,b' Nice job Joe! You\x92re quite the craftsmen.'
