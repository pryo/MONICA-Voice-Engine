Chandler:,b' Hey! Ready to go?'
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah, let me just finish this.'"
Joey:,"b"" Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his \n  fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!"""
Chandler:,"b"" What are you doin'?"""
Ross:,"b"" Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's \n  cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."""
Chandler:,"b"" Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and \n  childless ."""
Ross:,"b"" It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... \n  remember Andrea Rich?"""
Chandler:,"b"" The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?"""
Ross:,"b' Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an \n  ear in a boating accident... '"
Chandler:,"b"" Bet she'd sleep with you now... """
Ross:,b' No... I already e-mailed her.'
Chandler:,"b' Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, \n  two kids... "" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... \n  I think you split with Carol because you\'ve one very similar interest!'"
Ross:,"b"" You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab \n  my coat."""
Joey:,b' Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)'
Ross:,b' (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do \n  in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)'
Chandler:,"b' Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and \n  he start typing on Ross\' computer) ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She\'s \n  now my girlfriend. I don\'t care what society says. It\'s the best sex I\'ve ever \n  had""... aaand SEND!'"
Joey:,"b"" (he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what \n  do... you can't do that to him!"""
Ross:,"b"" (he comes back) Alright, let's go!"""
Joey:,"b"" Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)"""
Ross:,b' I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball \n  inside the house!'
Joey:,b' (after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)'
Rachel:,b' Hey! How was basketball?'
Joey:,"b' Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in \n  the eye!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, no! Who did that?'"
Joey:,"b"" Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near \n  Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)"""
Rachel:,"b"" She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let \n  her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?"""
Joey:,"b"" (still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed \n  animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!"""
Rachel:,"b' Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!'"
Joey:,"b"" Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like \n  him a normal amount... """
Rachel:,"b' All right... Oh, Emma loves him!'"
Joey:,"b"" Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!"""
Phoebe:,b' Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b' Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, I'm so sorry!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even \n  tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes \n  with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through \n  this... """
Chandler:,"b"" You're not gonna need my help?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready \n  to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just \n  thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never \n  wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... \n  but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again \n  and you have to stop me from doing that."""
Phoebe:,"b"" (after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... \n  Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still \n  can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."""
Phoebe:,b' That was a test and you just failed.'
Ross:,b' (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??'
Chandler:,b' I believe I read that somewhere!'
Ross:,"b"" That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending \n  on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... (pause) It's not funny!!"""
Chandler:,b' I respectfully disagree.'
Ross:,"b"" I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!"""
Chandler:,b' Who cares? Nobody reads those things'
Ross:,"b"" You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your \n  page today."""
Chandler:,"b"" I don't have a page."""
Ross:,b' Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!'
Joey:,"b"" Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... \n  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's \n  okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)"""
Rachel:,"b' (threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, \n  I have a weapon!'"
Joey:,"b"" It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."""
Rachel:,b' What are you doing?'
Joey:,"b' Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could \n  reach Hugsy.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go \n  to the bathroom."""
Joey:,"b"" (placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie... (to Emma) \n  This isn't over."""
Chandler:,b' Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.'
Chandler:,b' Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate \n  me all day.'
Chandler:,"b"" Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs \n  up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go \n  (starts typing something)."""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, you'll see my friend."""
Ross:,"b"" (visibly upset) I'm dead?"""
Chandler:,b' (faking sympathy) And so young.'
Ross:,"b"" Posting that I died? That really isn't funny."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, how you died was funny.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh please, hit by a blimp?'"
Chandler:,b' It kills over one americans every year.'
Ross:,"b"" Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, \n  my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings \n  here."""
Chandler:,"b"" You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard \n  how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to \n  go with him to Key West!"""
Ross:,"b"" You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok \n  'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. \n  That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic."""
Phoebe:,"b' God, I wish Mike were here.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."""
Phoebe:,b' Here.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps \n  in a closet and gives it to Monica)'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" You can't have it."""
Phoebe:,b' No (tucks it in her pants)'
Phoebe:,b' (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!'
Joey:,"b"" Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."""
Rachel:,"b"" Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home \n  in the middle of the day anymore."""
Joey:,"b"" No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's."""
Joey:,"b"" No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, \n  I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink \n  pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid \n  her tail... '"
Joey:,b' Make the transfer! (She does so)'
Rachel:,"b"" Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and \n  I can't find it?"""
Joey:,"b"" Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy."""
Joey:,"b"" But he's the same."""
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.'"
Joey:,"b"" But he's the same."""
Rachel:,"b' Joey, come on!'"
Joey:,"b"" He's the same!"""
Joey:,"b"" (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed \n  you into the building."""
Phoebe:,b' Those are my shoes.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually \n  feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."""
Phoebe:,b' I ordered Chinese food.'
Phoebe:,b' What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send \n  Mike!?'
Phoebe:,"b"" I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him."""
Phoebe:,b' There is a speakerphone on the base unit... '
Phoebe:,"b"" Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang \n  out as friends?"""
Phoebe:,b' Sit down.'
Phoebe:,"b' Thanks, you look good too.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" So how's the piano playing going?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" I've missed you too."""
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (\xc2\xadlooks at laptop \n  screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"""
Ross:,"b' uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop \n  screen)'"
Chandler:,"b"" Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and \n  was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out \n  are ya?"""
Ross:,"b' Eh..actually no, I don\'t need to because your little ""Ross is \n  dead"" joke didn\'t work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything \n  on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody \n  called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I\'m dead. (silence) Oh my God! \n  Nobody cares that I\'m dead!?'"
Chandler:,"b"" No, come on, you know that's not true."""
Ross:,"b"" What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming \n  out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!"""
Chandler:,"b' Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead \n  community.'"
Ross:,"b"" I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried \n  that guy! (gets up from his sofa)"""
Chandler:,"b"" Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think \n  that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are \n  gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that \n  you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."""
Ross:,"b"" You're right. There isn't a decent outlet."""
Chandler:,"b"" Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral \n  or a memorial service, tons of people would come."""
Ross:,b' Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)'
Chandler:,"b"" Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks \n  at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"""
Ross:,"b"" No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"""
Ross:,"b"" oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the \n  picture of you and the police man... """
Rachel:,"b"" I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?"""
Joey:,b' Original or crappy?'
Rachel:,b' Original.'
Joey:,"b"" No, sorry haven't seen him."""
Rachel:,"b"" Then what's that big lump under your covers?"""
Joey:,"b"" It's Monica, ok?"""
Rachel:,"b"" That's not Monica!"""
Joey:,"b"" Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma \n  wants him but he's mine and I need him.."""
Rachel:,b' (to herself) Oh God.'
Joey:,"b"" ... she's being unreasonable!"""
Rachel:,"b"" (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid \n  penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) \n  It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!"""
Joey:,b' It does?'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle \n  Joey so much."""
Joey:,b' Really? She... she loves me?'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. \n  Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room)."""
Joey:,"b' Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I \n  mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns \n  to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!"""
Joey:,"b"" Look forget it forget it... I can't do it."""
Rachel:,"b"" Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little \n  child?"""
Joey:,b' How do you think I got him in the first place?'
Phoebe:,"b' I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?'"
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)'"
Phoebe:,b' Who is this?'
Ross:,"b"" It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I \n  tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"""
Chandler:,b' There you go! Someone came!'
Ross:,"b"" Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! \n  (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)"""
Chandler:,"b' (in a mournful voice) Please, come in.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.'"
Chandler:,b' At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he \n  goes in the bedroom)'
Ross:,b' Who is he?'
Chandler:,"b' Some guy, Tom Gordon.'"
Ross:,"b"" I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. \n  (they press their ears against the door)"""
Chandler:,"b"" (entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for \n  you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)"""
Chandler:,b' Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)'
Ross:,"b"" (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?"""
Chandler:,"b' Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!'"
Ross:,"b"" It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!"""
Chandler:,"b"" You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class \n  checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"""
Ross:,"b"" Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, \n  I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's \n  15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"""
Ross:,b' (sceptical) Yeah... '
Chandler:,"b"" I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides \n  in the bedroom again)"""
Chandler:,b' Kori? Kori Weston?'
Chandler:,b' Wow! You look amazing!'
Chandler:,"b"" Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."""
Chandler:,"b"" Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her \n  in)"""
Chandler:,"b"" I didn't know Ross and you were so close."""
Chandler:,"b"" I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a \n  door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."""
Ross:,"b"" (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! \n  Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things \n  you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more \n  to me than if this room were filled with people!"""
Ross:,b' Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!'
Ross:,"b"" (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something \n  to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's \n  over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. \n  (pause) Monica?"""
