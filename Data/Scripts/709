Ross:,b' You sure?'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)'"
Ross:,"b' No-no, one daddy, two '"
Chandler:,b' Okay. Okay.'
Ross:,b' Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)'
Phoebe:,"b' His first big kid\x92s bike, this is so exciting!'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' I never had a bike of my own.'
Ross:,b' (shocked) What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, we didn\x92t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street\nhad the '"
Chandler:,b' That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My\ndad gave me his old one.'
Ross:,b' Ohh.'
Phoebe:,b' No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the\nbike on the front. (They\x92re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad\nwould drag me around the backyard.'
Ross:,b' That is so unfair!'
Phoebe:,"b' Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod,\n""Oh."")'"
Chandler:,b' Hey! What are you guys doing? '
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sorry, who?'"
Chandler:,b' But we don\x92t know the neighbors.'
Joey:,"b' I do. There\x92s uh, let\x92s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot\nLady, Some Kids I\x92ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.'"
Chandler:,b' Wouldn\x92t it be easier if we just moved?'
Rachel:,"b' (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!'"
Chandler:,"b' Eh, somebody\x92s in a good mood!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, why shouldn\x92t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful\njob!'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on, it\x92s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with\na plan so that us dating will not be a problem.'"
Rachel:,b' (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We\x85 We are not\x85\n\x85going to let it\x85 be a problem.'
Rachel:,"b' Well y\x92know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to\ngiggle.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh Monica come on, y\x92know I don\x92t sleep with guys on the first\ndate!'"
Rachel:,b' Anymore!!'
Rachel:,"b' Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, thank you. That\x92ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag\nstarts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes\nthe office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on\nbetween us. (They kiss.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you hard worker! I\x92ll remember to put that in your\nevaluation.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, you\x92ve been here for two months now and your boss is required\nto hand in a performance evaluation. But y\x92know, there is one thing that I have yet\nto evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.) '"
Rachel:,"b' No, I\x92ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this\nup?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, either that or uh\x85(Motions towards Joey\x92s door.)'"
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was\nonly a couple of pieces left!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, and they\x92ve been coming by all day. They love it!'"
Joey:,"b' Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something\nmight\x92ve happened to a huge chunk of it.'"
Ross:,b' Mine stole my newspaper! It\x92s like a '
Phoebe:,b' Sure!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I\ncouldn\x92t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a '"
Phoebe:,b' (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!'
Ross:,b' You like it?'
Phoebe:,b' I '
Ross:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,b' Ohh!! Ohh!! And I '
Ross:,b' Ahh.'
Phoebe:,b' Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!'
Ross:,"b' Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y\x92know give it\na test ride.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I\x92ve\never gotten.'
Ross:,b' (stunned at the compliment) You\x92re welcome.'
Phoebe:,"b' (starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler\x92s about to cry.'"
Chandler:,b' (about to cry) Am not!'
Chandler:,"b' Don\x92t worry, I\x92m brave! I am brave! I\x85I am brave! (They\nget to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the\ndoor.) Can you tell me who is there please?'"
Chandler:,b' (laughs) 4:00 A.M.'
Chandler:,"b' I am sorry, but some of us have to '"
Chandler:,b' Mm! Night Gar\x92! (Monica closes the door.)'
Rachel:,b' (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?'
Rachel:,"b' (worried) Okay please, you\x92re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a\njoke for you!'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m thinkin\x92 no.'
Rachel:,"b' Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like\nyour tiney-tiny tushie.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,\n""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems\nwith Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a\nlittle smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.'"
Joey:,b' Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about '"
Joey:,b' (about to cry) Those two only had each other!'
Ross:,b' Phoebe really likes the bike huh?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin\x92 it by the park.'"
Ross:,"b' Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?'"
Joey:,b' Hey Pheebs?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh hi!'
Chandler:,b' Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, uh-huh so much!'"
Ross:,b' Pheebs you uh\x85you do know how to ride a bike don\x92t you?'
Phoebe:,b' Of course!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (The gang is giggles then as Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,\ngets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?'"
Chandler:,b' (with his mouth full) What happened? I\x92m just eating candy.'
Rachel:,"b' Maybe it\x92s not as bad as I think. Y\x92know, maybe they\ndidn\x92t take it the way I meant it.'"
Chandler:,"b' Absolutely! Y\x92know, because tushie can mean both ass and good\nworker.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!'"
Joey:,b' Hey Rach?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,b' That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like\nthis? (He shows her what he\x92s been drawing.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Joey!'
Chandler:,b' What is the matter with you?'
Rachel:,b' Ugh!'
Joey:,"b' Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford\nporn.'"
Joey:,"b' (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?'"
Chandler:,"b' Maybe, isn\x92t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really\nloud?'"
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know what would work?'
Chandler:,b' Stop making candy!'
Chandler:,b' You mean they like you.'
Chandler:,b' Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?'
Ross:,"b' Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you\x92ll be fine.\nOkay? Here we go. Ready\x85Set\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' (hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,\nmaybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane\nseat\x97or a beanbag chair!'"
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, you can\x92t get out of this! Okay? You '"
Phoebe:,b' Why? Why do I '
Ross:,b' Well\x85In-in case of emergency.'
Phoebe:,b' What kind of an emergency?'
Ross:,"b' Well let there\x97what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head\nand says, ""You ride this bike or I\x92ll sh\x85I\x92ll shoot you.""'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the\ngun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and\x97Hey! I\x92ll hold\nyou up and-and push you. Okay?'"
Phoebe:,b' You won\x92t let go?'
Ross:,b' No!'
Phoebe:,b' Swear?!'
Ross:,b' I swear!'
Phoebe:,b' (thinks it over) Okay. '
Ross:,"b' Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They\nstart.) '"
Phoebe:,b' All right.'
Ross:,b' All right. Feel good?'
Phoebe:,b' Well\x85'
Ross:,"b' All right, try pedaling. '"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (Does so.)'
Ross:,"b' That\x92s it, your doing great.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!'
Phoebe:,b' Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)'
Ross:,b' Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him\nand falls off the bike.)'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!'
Ross:,b' I-I just thought you were doing so well. I\x85'
Phoebe:,b' I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself\nfrom the angry looks from onlookers.)'
Ross:,b' It\x92s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the\nwoman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!'
Ross:,"b' Hey, there\x92s uh, some people outside, askin\x92 about candy.'"
Ross:,b' Need some help?'
Ross:,"b' By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She\nglares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe\x92s room.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.'"
Ross:,"b' (entering) Look, I-I\x92m really sorry I let go of the bike.'"
Phoebe:,b' I could\x92ve been killed I hope you know!'
Ross:,"b' I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were '"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I would love to but\x85the bike got stolen and the police have\nno suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something\nthat suspiciously looks like a bike.) '"
Ross:,b' Phoebe.'
Phoebe:,b' What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!'
Ross:,"b' All right, y\x92know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride\nthis bike then I\x92m sorry, I\x92m just gonna have to take it back.'"
Phoebe:,b' What?! Why?!'
Ross:,"b' Because! Because, it-it-it\x92s\x85 It\x92d be like you having this\nguitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar '"
Phoebe:,"b' All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.'"
Ross:,b' Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You\x92re making the bike very\nhappy.'
Phoebe:,b' (sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)\nPlease don\x92t die!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but\nwe\x92re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner\x92s office. Now, he doesn\x92t get in\nuntil 10, so he\x92s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her\nbreakfast at her desk.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her\naway with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,\n'"
Rachel:,b' Let\x92s roll!'
Rachel:,"b' (worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you\nanything\x97minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to\nusher Tag out.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some\nchocolates? (Holds up the box.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting\nserious) what would happen exactly.'"
Rachel:,b' Well\x85'
Rachel:,b' Oh no-no-no\x85'
Rachel:,b' You\x92re lookin\x92 at it upside down\x97y\x92know what? (Grabs\nthe evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn\x92t matter.'
Rachel:,b' Whoa! I can\x92t believe you did that. That was really sweet.'
Rachel:,"b' No, you could\x92ve lost your job.'"
Rachel:,b' Thank you! You\x92re great! (They kiss.)'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' I\x85 It just\x97it took me so long to get that desk organized.'
Rachel:,b' (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)'
Chandler:,b' (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on? '
Joey:,b' Yeah lady! Give us candy!!'
Chandler:,b' Joey!'
Joey:,b' What\x92s up buddy?'
Chandler:,b' What are you doing?'
Joey:,b' Waiting for candy.'
Chandler:,"b' Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot\nLady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!\n(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.'"
Chandler:,"b' All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!\nPipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman\nwas trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to\nknow all of you, and I\x92ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?'"
Chandler:,b' No not (imitating) Candy Lady.'
Joey:,"b' (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have\ncandy?!!'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, y\x92know what? Forget it, all of you forget it!\nYou\x92ve ruined it! Go home! You\x92ve ruined it! You\x92ve ruined it!'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s right, it\x92s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You\nruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to\nthe candy and starts eating it.)'"
Chandler:,b' You\x92re welcome. (They kiss.)'
Chandler:,b' No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.\nEh-uh\x97are you okay?'
Joey:,"b' (with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or\nwhatever, I don\x92t know\x85 (Grabs the note.)'"
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought\nI\x92d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.'
Ross:,"b' Oh hey, don\x92t thank me, thank yourself. You\x92re the one who faced\nher fears and ultimately overcame them.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Don\x92t be so corny Ross, it\x92s not an after-school special. (She\nrides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly\nattached.)'"
