Joey:,"b' You guys, can we please not watch this all right.'"
Joey:,"b"" (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the\ncounter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!"""
Joey:,b' Can we please turn this off?'
Rachel:,"b' Noo way, Kevin.'"
Ross:,b' (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?'
Chandler:,"b"" You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!"""
Joey:,"b' (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.\n(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Well, it's official there are no good movies."""
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, man. What's up?"""
Joey:,"b"" Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at\nthe audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How\ncould you not give me the message?!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."""
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was\nme! '"
Joey:,b' How is it you?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was\nin the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.\nI-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him\nher hand)"""
Joey:,"b"" Yep, that's my audition."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."""
Joey:,"b' Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed\nmy chance.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault."""
Joey:,"b"" Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,\nshe only talks to agents."""
Phoebe:,"b' What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing). '"
Joey:,"b' What, what are you doing? What are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)\n'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,\nshe'll know what it's about.'"""
Joey:,"b"" Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he\ntries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,\napparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't\nknow what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down\nthe apartment, the world does not stop.'"""
Chandler:,b' Is anybody else scared?'
Phoebe:,"b"" (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is\nit for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to\nMonica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she\ntilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)"""
Chandler:,b' Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!'
Ross:,"b"" There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a\nBarbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a """

Joey:,b' I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)'
Joey:,"b"" I'm sorry, it just felt nice."""
Chandler:,b' (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.'
Joey:,"b' Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.\nGo get me a sweater.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see\nher tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."""
Rachel:,"b"" What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?"""
Chandler:,"b' Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her\nchicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.'"
Ross:,"b"" And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"""
Chandler:,b' Noo.'
Ross:,"b"" You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to\nyou."""
Chandler:,"b"" No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm\nstarted going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'"""
Rachel:,b' Men are unbelievable.'
Chandler:,"b"" I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of\nthought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say\nsomething stupid."""
Joey:,"b' Hey, you know about that?!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of\nthe commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! """
Ross:,b' (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.'
Chandler:,"b"" Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we\nhave any thoughts here?"""
Joey:,"b"" Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand\nit, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it\nseems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear\nof heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.\nRight. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the\nmost committed guy there ever was."""
Rachel:,"b' Amazingly, that makes sense.'"
Chandler:,b' You think?'
Joey:,"b' Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of\nthe gun, pee into the wind!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm\npretty much peeing every which way."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and\npretend agents."""
Joey:,"b' Come on baby, come on!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a\npage. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"""
Rachel:,b' Very nice touch.'
Phoebe:,"b"" (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi\nAnnie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it.

Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to\nhave lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a\ntunnel."""
Rachel:,b' Unbelievable.'
Joey:,b' Thank you so much.'
Phoebe:,"b"" It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."""
Joey:,"b"" You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's\nthis one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."""
Joey:,"b"" Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."""
Phoebe:,b' Two?'
Joey:,"b"" Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love\nyou."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"""
Joey:,"b' Nooo, four.'"
Chandler:,"b"" 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)"""
Chandler:,"b"" Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into\nyour brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."""
Chandler:,"b"" Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what\ngirlfriends should, should get. """
Chandler:,"b"" Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's\nmore. We should take a trip."""
Chandler:,"b"" Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your\nparents. We should take a trip with your parents!"""
Chandler:,"b"" I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have\nfeared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably\nsay 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."""
Chandler:,"b"" It doesn't scare me!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm\nhopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!

Rachel:,"b' Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)'"
Chandler:,"b' So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going\nto fast and we have to slow down.'"
Chandler:,b' Then I got all needy and clingy.'
Rachel:,"b"" Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so\nbad. How did you leave it?"""
Chandler:,"b"" She said she'd call me."""
Chandler:,b' Oh God.'
Chandler:,b' This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we\nsave the real stuff for those really terminal cases."""
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, you do.'"
Chandler:,"b"" So, you don't think I'm terminal?"""
Chandler:,"b' Okay, okay. So, should I call her?'"
Rachel:,"b' This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching\nfor that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want\nher back you have to start acting aloof.'"
Rachel:,"b' Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her\non purpose. And then act aloof.'"
Chandler:,"b"" So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."""
Chandler:,"b"" I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"""

Joey:,"b"" It's okay, these things happen."""
Phoebe:,"b"" But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,\nterrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."""
Joey:,"b"" I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)"""

Joey:,"b"" No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,\nrejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."""
Phoebe:,"b' Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian\nactor with a worse Italian accent.'"
Joey:,b' They actually said that?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."""
Joey:,"b"" No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You\nknow, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in\na very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent."""

Joey:,"b' Okay, shoot.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.'"
Joey:,"b"" I didn't get it?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can\nwork on that. """
Joey:,"b' Okay, what else?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"""
