Ross:,"b"" OK, now I'm nervous."""
Rachel:,b' Maybe you should put it off.'
Ross:,"b"" No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year\nbeing so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I\nmean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know."""
Rachel:,"b' I know, yeah, sorry.'"
Ross:,"b"" What, it's not your fault."""
Rachel:,"b"" Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were\non the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like\nthat."""
Ross:,b' Really?'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd\nwant you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good\nkiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from\nmy face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is\nabout to happen."""
Ross:,b' (being drawn in by her talk) Uh-huh.'
Rachel:,"b"" And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so\nthat, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind\nof sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening."""
