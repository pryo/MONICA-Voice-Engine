Chandler:,"b' Hey, you guys!'"
Chandler:,"b' So, what do you think?'"
Ross:,b' About what?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, what?'"
Joey:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Are you kidding? Okay, I\x92ll give you a hint; I\x92ll give you a\nhint. (Points to his glasses.)'"
Joey:,"b' Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler\x92s eyes!'"
Chandler:,b' I got glasses!'
Ross:,"b' Well, you-you\x92ve always had glasses.'"
Chandler:,b' No I didn\x92t!'
Ross:,b' Are you sure?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah-yeah, did-didn\x92t you use to have a pair? They were really\nround, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm\x85'"
Joey:,b' Feminine.'
Rachel:,b' Yes!'
Chandler:,b' No!'
Chandler:,b' Really?'
Chandler:,"b' (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn\x92t think I used to\nwear glasses, right?'"
Phoebe:,b' So what do you guys want for an engagement present?'
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s okay Pheebs, we\x92re not having a party or anything, so\nyou don\x92t have to get us\x85'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, y\x92know what you should get \x91em? One of those little uh,\nportable CD players.'"
Phoebe:,b' Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.'"
Chandler:,b' What '
Phoebe:,b' You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?'
Phoebe:,b' You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that\nI would never let out of our family?'
Chandler:,b' Dying people say the '
Phoebe:,"b' Break my heart\x97Oh, all right.'"
Chandler:,b' Our kids are gonna be '
Joey:,b' (entering) Ahoy!'
Chandler:,b' Hey! How\x92s the boat?!'
Joey:,b' Great! I\x92m finally getting into this sailing stuff.'
Joey:,b' Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!'
Phoebe:,"b' If you don\x92t sail your boat, what do you do on it?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, it\x92s great! It\x92s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang\naround, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks\na beer, and eats a chip.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, it\x92s good that you finally have a place to do that.'"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.'"
Joey:,b' You could?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah! I\x92ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad\nbought me my own boat.'
Phoebe:,b' Your own boat?'
Rachel:,b' What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.'
Chandler:,b' Do you know what I was thinkin\x92?'
Chandler:,"b' Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)'"
Ross:,"b' (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?'"
Chandler:,"b' Uh why, do you have a lecture?'"
Ross:,"b' No, why?'"
Chandler:,b' Then free as a bird. What\x92s up?'
Ross:,b' My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah and he didn\x92t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed\nhe meant you.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, did-did you correct him?'"
Ross:,"b' No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.'"
Ross:,b' Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the\ntrash cans. He does that every week too.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh no problem, maybe I\x92ll play with my left hand.'"
Ross:,b' You\x92re not a lefty? '
Chandler:,b' Does anybody know me?!'
Phoebe:,b' I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the\n'
Phoebe:,b' (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I\x92m normal!\nThat was the '
Ross:,"b' Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?'"
Chandler:,b' Don\x92t worry about it Pheebs.'
Ross:,b' No one got me an engagement present.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie\nin a plastic baggie.) '"
Chandler:,b' An old cookie?'
Phoebe:,"b' See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.'"
Chandler:,b' We can\x92t accept this.'
Phoebe:,b' Why not?'
Chandler:,b' \x91Cause it\x92s gross.'
Phoebe:,b' Really?!'
Chandler:,"b' Okay, we owe you a present.'"
Ross:,b' Two! I\x92ve been engaged twice!'
Joey:,b' (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he\x92s got a bigger\nboat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To\nRachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?'
Rachel:,b' That '
Joey:,"b' What are they doing out here? The coast\x92s all the way over there.\n(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We\x92re not finished with the\nlesson yet.'"
Joey:,b' All right.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, I\x92m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,\nare you ready?'"
Joey:,"b' Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let\x92s start sailing, and I\nwant to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)\nYo-ho-ho!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a\nlittle shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let\x92s do that Sailor Joe. Quick\nquestion though, (grabs some of the rigging) what\x92s this called?'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, boat rope.'"
Rachel:,b' Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?'
Joey:,"b'  Uh, rub it?'"
Rachel:,b' No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?'
Joey:,"b' I\x92d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this\none, uh\x85'"
Rachel:,"b"" Time\x92s up, now you're dead."""
Joey:,b' And deaf!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not\nknow what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you\nsailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)'"
Joey:,b' Yes.'
Rachel:,"b' Don\x92t just say yes! This isn\x92t a game, Joey, you can really get\nhurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!'"
Joey:,b' I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.'
Phoebe:,b' You do?'
Phoebe:,b' That and arrogance.'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t want to talk about it. Y\x92know, you could\x92ve at\nleast saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what\x92s left of the cookie and pops in his\nmouth.)'"
Joey:,b' (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)'
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t believe that! Now the only thing left of my\ngrandmother\x92s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out\nto Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.'
Ross:,b' (entering with Chandler) Hey.'
Ross:,b' Well '
Chandler:,b' '
Ross:,b' And what did he ask you not to call him?'
Chandler:,"b' Daddy. All right look, here\x92s the story. (Flashback to Chandler\nabout to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished\nplaying racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was\nreally steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way\naround the steam-filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and\nthat\x92s when it happened.'"
Chandler:,b' Guys?'
Ross:,b' Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)'
Chandler:,b' I know.'
Chandler:,b' Why do they put so much steam in there?!'
Ross:,b' \x91Cause otherwise they\x92d have to call it the room room.'
Chandler:,b' Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?'
Phoebe:,"b' Come on, it\x92s not that big a deal!'"
Chandler:,b' Not that big a deal? There\x85there was touching of things.'
Ross:,"b' Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to\nbond to that part?'"
Chandler:,b' I don\x92t want him to tell this story for years.'
Ross:,"b' Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from\nfat camp.'"
Ross:,b' Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?'
Ross:,b' You were trying to eat it!'
Chandler:,b' If '
Chandler:,"b' (getting up) All right, I\x92m off to see your dad.'"
Ross:,"b' Whoa-whoa, aren\x92t you a little over dressed?'"
Rachel:,"b' (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story\nanymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face\x97And by face I\ndon\x92t mean his lap. And by face, I don\x92t mean my ass. (Exits.)'"
Ross:,b' (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know. Y\x92know, they didn\x92t get us anything.'"
Ross:,b' Thank you!'
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b' Well hello! So, when are we gettin\x92 back out on the water matey? '"
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, I don\x92t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!'"
Rachel:,b' Why not?'
Joey:,b' Because! You\x92re mean on the boat!'
Rachel:,b' What? I was just trying to teach you.'
Joey:,"b' Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!'"
Ross:,b' Yeeeeeep\x85 Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took me out on her\ndad\x92s boat she wouldn\x92t let me help at all.'
Rachel:,"b' Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn\x92t move your arms\nbecause you were wearing three life jackets.'"
Ross:,b' You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)'
Rachel:,"b' Look Joey, I\x92m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta\ntell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all\nthe time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.'"
Joey:,"b' Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?""'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?'"
Joey:,b' Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, I didn\x92t want you to get hit by the boom!'"
Joey:,b' Well it hit me anyway! And it would\x92ve hurt a lot less if I had\nfinished that last beer.'
Rachel:,"b' All right, y\x92know what? I-I\x92m sorry. I will try to tone it\ndown and uh stop yelling.'"
Joey:,b' You won\x92t boss me around anymore?'
Rachel:,b' I won\x92t boss you around.'
Joey:,b' And you\x92ll be nice?'
Rachel:,"b' And, I\x92ll be nice.'"
Joey:,b' And you\x92ll be topless?'
Rachel:,b' And\x97Joey!'
Joey:,b' Do you want me to learn?!'
Ross:,b' Let\x92s give it a shot.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?'"
Ross:,"b'  Oh, these are pretty good.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.'"
Ross:,b' Which one was that?'
Ross:,b' Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did '
Phoebe:,b' Are there any more from the good batch? \x91Cause we could just work\noff of those.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh\x85 (Grabs a\ncookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn\x92t like it.) It\x92s batch 16! 16\npeople! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay Joey honey, you\x92re doing really good! All right, now I\x92m\njust gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which\nside is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?'"
Joey:,b'  Oh yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Right?'
Joey:,b' Nope.'
Rachel:,"b' It\x92s left sweetie, but that\x92s okay sweetie, that\x92s a\ntough one.'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know why you just don\x92t say left.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of\nthe boat.) The left!'"
Joey:,b' Huh?'
Rachel:,b' (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)'
Joey:,"b' (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you\x92re yelling again! See that?'"
Rachel:,"b' No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, y\x92know what? Since I\x92m here, I think I\x92m gonna have me\na little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay Joey, we\x92re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the\ncunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working\nefficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn\x92t know there.'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, y\x92know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead\nwith the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!'"
Rachel:,b' (angrily) No! All right?! I did '
Joey:,b' All right that\x92s it! You\x92re yelling and I don\x92t see you\ntaking your top off! I quit!'
Rachel:,b' What do you mean you quit?! You can\x92t quit!'
Joey:,b' Why not?!'
Rachel:,b' Because you\x92re not finished yet and I won\x92t have it! Greens do\nnot quit!'
Joey:,b' Greens? I\x92m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, wait did I\x97I just said Greens don\x92t quit\ndidn\x92t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don\x92t quit?!'"
Joey:,b' Yes! Yes! You did and you\x92re still yelling at me!'
Rachel:,"b' No! No! No! I\x92m not yelling at you, I\x92m just yelling near you.\nOh God Joey, oh I\x92m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I\x92ve been trying so\nhard not to be my mother I did not see this comin\x92. Oh, Joey, I\x92m sorry.\nI\x92m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, hey I did learn.'"
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Joey:,b' Yeah! Come on.'
Rachel:,b' Awww\x85'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It\x92s\nthe larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is\nright.'"
Rachel:,b' Left.'
Joey:,b' Damnit!'
Phoebe:,"b' Y\x92know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to\nknow that we\x92re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she\x92s l-l-lookin\x92 up\nat us and smiling right now.'"
Ross:,b' Looking up?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah\x97No, she was really nice to me, but she\x92s in hell for\nsure.'"
Ross:,"b' Aww, Pheeb, come on isn\x92t there any relative that would have the\nrecipe? What about, what about your sister?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk\nto Ursula would be over my dead body. And that\x92s not happening \x91til October 15'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s the day you\x92re gonna die? See\x97darnit, I\x92ve got\nshuffleboard that day.'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s what you think.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, y\x92know I may have relatives in France who would know. My\ngrandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.'"
Phoebe:,b' Nesele Toulouse.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.'"
Phoebe:,b' (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.)\nOh.'
Phoebe:,b' I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)\nyou\x92re burning in hell!!'
Chandler:,"b' So you understand, I\x92d feel a lot more comfortable if you\ndidn\x92t tell people what happened. Y\x92know, I\x92m a little\x85I\x92m a\nlittle embarrassed about it.'"
Chandler:,b' What did you do when they found out?'
Chandler:,b' So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!'
Rachel:,"b' Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don\x92t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)'"
Rachel:,b'  Oh we\x92re not sailing.'
Joey:,b' Just pull on it.'
Rachel:,b' All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)\nHey-hey-hey!! (Sees what\x92s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!'
Joey:,b' What else?'
Rachel:,b' (hands him one) Here you go.'
Joey:,b' Thank you.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the\nstuff falls out.)'"
Joey:,b' What are you doing?'
Rachel:,"b'  Oh, sorry.'"
Joey:,b' What you\x97don\x92t hold it like that! You\x92re lettin\x92 all\nthe good stuff fall out.'
Rachel:,b'  Oh whoops.'
Joey:,b' Careful! You\x92re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I\x92m '
