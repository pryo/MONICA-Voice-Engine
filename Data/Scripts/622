Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' So what-what is the exhibit.'
Phoebe:,b' It\x92s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed\nwith video games and free sandwiches.'
Joey:,b' Oh man! (Hits Chandler)'
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'

Ross:,b' Why? What?'
Ross:,"b' No, no, that\x92s funny. But maybe it\x92s time to move on, let it go,\ny\x92know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth\x92s father, so ah,\nhe\x92s much older than she is. Looks like I\x92m not the only one interested in\nfossils, huh?'"
Rachel:,b' I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in\nfossils.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings\n(Paul enters) in '"

Ross:,"b' Really? That okay, that\x92s great.'"
Ross:,"b' All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.'"
Ross:,"b' But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don\x92t think\nthere\x92s really anything you can do about it.'"
Ross:,b' Ohh! A man with a plan!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of\nfame! Eek!'"
Joey:,b' I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi\nwould just be crackin\x92 up about something\x85 Then I get fired off of '
Phoebe:,"b' (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you\nnext to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we\x92d be great\ntogether!'"
Joey:,b' Hey! So I\x92m back.'
Joey:,"b' Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn\x92t remember)\nOkay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.)\nHuh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I\x92m ready to go back up on the wall I\x92m the star of a\nnew TV show.'"

Phoebe:,"b' So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer\x92s clothes here? Maybe?\nJust ones that haven\x92t been cleaned yet? '"
Rachel:,b' Umm.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, the gift shop!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, and then lunch.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, wait yes, but I can\x92t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to\ndinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he\x92s gonna tell you that he\x92s\ngay?'"
Rachel:,b' What?! No! Why?!'
Phoebe:,"b' No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?'"
Rachel:,b' I didn\x92t know you could get married here.'
Rachel:,b' Oh sorry didn\x92t mean to interrupt. It\x92s just such a beautiful\nspace; do you do a lot of weddings here?'
Rachel:,"b' Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but there\x92s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged\nin two years and then you got to wait '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah hon, it can\x92t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two\nyears if you\x92re not engaged you just don\x92t use it.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m gonna do it too!'

Phoebe:,"b' I don\x92t know, I don\x92t have anyone right now. Y\x92know?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh Pheebs.'
Phoebe:,b' Don\x92t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn\x92t gay.'
Phoebe:,b' Don\x92t even get me started on yours!'
Joey:,"b' (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?'"
Joey:,"b' All right, let\x92s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)'"

Ross:,"b' Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.'"
Ross:,"b' No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then\nsees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh,\nprotection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no! Hey-hey, I\x92m the guy! I\x92ll get it.'"

Ross:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,"b' Ohh, okay.'"

Chandler:,"b' (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens)\nYes, the groom\x97No! Not the groom!!'"
Rachel:,b' It\x92s so secluded up here.'
Rachel:,"b' I feel like we\x92re the only two people in the world. (She sets down\nher wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She\nreaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and\ncauses Rachel to scream.)'"
Rachel:,"b' No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I\x97would\nyou\x97actually, would you go check on that?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, okay. Would-would you get me a '"

Ross:,b' (before entering) Did you really hear a bear?'
Rachel:,b' Go-go!'
Rachel:,"b' Ohh, thank you.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to\nthe closed garage.'"
Rachel:,b' Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, why do y\x92know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in)\nand do your homework?'"
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s your, that\x92s your dad\x92s bedroom. (Yelling)\nThat\x92s your dad\x92s bedroom!'"
Rachel:,"b' Whoa, that '"

Chandler:,b' (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He\nstorms out.)'
Chandler:,b' (on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The\nmachine beeps off.)'
Joey:,"b' Uh yeah, where-where\x92s the guy who decides who\x92s pictures go up\non the wall?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, you\x92re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him\nthat Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I\x92m an actor;\nI\x92m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You\x92re\nthe other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Really? Okay. Okay, I-I\x92ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me\nsomething from the car.'"

Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,b' No! Why?'
Phoebe:,"b' Well for the regular guy, it\x92s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!'"
Phoebe:,b' What are you gonna do?'
Phoebe:,b' Rachel said that!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you\nsign it, ""Son of a bitch?"" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire\npicture.)'"
Joey:,b' I didn\x92t do that! Who would\x92ve done that?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, maybe ask this guy.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, what did he do?'"
Phoebe:,b' Joey!'
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I\x97Hey! I did '"

Rachel:,b' (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don\x92t go in\nthere! Don\x92t go in there! I need another soda!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God Ross! What in heaven\x92s name are you doing here?'
Ross:,b' (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain\x85'"
Ross:,"b' All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you\nand I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)'"
Ross:,b' And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics\nPaul\x92s flexing.)'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named\nHeldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of\nthose Chandler noises.)'"
Chandler:,b' Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)'
Chandler:,"b' Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me\nwere you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who\nare available by the way!'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, if it really doesn\x92t mean anything, because you know that\nI\x92m just not ready\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. (They hug.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?'"
Chandler:,b' Totally.'
Phoebe:,b' So did Heldi show you the place?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s beautiful.'"
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t believe you\x92re gonna ask Monica to marry you!'
Chandler:,b' I know.'
Joey:,b' Hey Gunther.'
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.'"
Joey:,"b' No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?\nI\x92m sorry.'"
Joey:,b' Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)'
