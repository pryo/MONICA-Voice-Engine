Joey:,b' (to Lauren) In a minute!!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he\ncan talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I\ngotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick \x91cause this is killing me. One thing\nyou gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you\x92ve got things you have to\ndo now, and so do I. And so\x85 I\x92m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts\npouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the\nside of it) and I\x92m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I\nreturn, 200 years from now, you\x92ll be long gone. But I won\x92t have aged at all.\n(gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because\nAdrienne, baby, I\x92m gonna want to meet her. '"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it\x92s one of those 801 numbers. Right?'"
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it\x92s has to be 800. (picks up the\ninstruction manual to check the phone number) \x91Cause all those big companies have 800\nnumbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.'"
Rachel:,b' Phoe-be!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Sorry, I\x92m so sorry, I will pay you back.'"
Chandler:,"b' And yet, she\x92s still not hanging up the phone.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I think I broke it. But that\x92s all right, here\x92s the\nnumber you can call.'"
