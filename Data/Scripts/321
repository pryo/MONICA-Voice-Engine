Rachel:,b' So who\x92s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God, they took my idea!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God, are you guys okay?'"
Joey:,b' (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is\nmoaning in pain.) Oh my.'
Chandler:,b' (sporting a goatee) Hey.'
Joey:,"b"" Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan."""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, so that\x92s why the priest threw holy water on me.\n(there\x92s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, '"
Joey:,"b' Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy\x92s theory.\nOkay?'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' (triumphantly) I\x92m gonna be on TV!!'
Chandler:,b' No way!'
Ross:,b' Yeah! They\x92re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils\nthey just found in Peru and '
Chandler:,b' Oh my God! Who\x92s gonna watch that?!'
Ross:,b' Thanks. You ready to go?'
Chandler:,b' Yeah. (they start to leave)'
Joey:,b' Saw a girl with that vest.'
Chandler:,b' Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)'
Joey:,"b' (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? \x91Cause I\nwas watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!'"
Rachel:,b' What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?'
Rachel:,b' And you\x92re still not attracted to him at all?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but Mon that\x92s totally different. He was you\x92re health\nteacher.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.'"
Rachel:,b' I know. '
Rachel:,b' Ow!!'
Ross:,"b' (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!\nGuess what?'"
Rachel:,b' (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?'
Ross:,"b"" Y'know what I didn\x92t wear this suit for a year because you hated it.\nWell, guess what? You\x92re not my girlfriend anymore so..."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.'"
Ross:,b' Right.'
Rachel:,"b' Now that you\x92re on you\x92re own, you\x92re free to look as\nstupid as you like.'"
Ross:,b' (to Monica) You like it right?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, come here!'"
Rachel:,b' Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, good bye! (leaves)'"
Chandler:,"b' So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take\nfor the roller skating thing to happen.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, oh, about three months.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, so I guess that\x92s about ah, two weeks before the topless\nthing kicks in.'"
Joey:,b' (entering carrying a box) Hey!!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' I got you something! Open it! Open it!'
Chandler:,b' Okay. (He opens it and it\x92s a baby chick) It\x92s a chicken.'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s cute, huh?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?'"
Chandler:,b' Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They\nrequire constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot\x92s and lot\x92s\nof love.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,\nand talks to it like it\x92s a little baby.)'"
Chandler:,b' Easy Lenny.'
Phoebe:,"b' (to Pete) Wow! That\x92s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m just saying, this woman, I mean she\x92s fictitious. No?'"
Phoebe:,"b' \x91Cause you\x92re still into Monica. So you told her there was\nsomebody else so she would agree to work with you, so \x91cause you figure oh if you\nspent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, no, I\x92m fairly intuitive and psychic. It\x92s a substantial\ngift.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No I\x92m serious. I mean I\x92m intuitive, but my memory sucks.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,\nand a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey\nenters)-chickeeeen.'"
Joey:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' How\x92s she doing?'
Chandler:,b' She?'
Joey:,"b' Well yeah, don\x92t-don\x92t you think it\x92s a she?'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to\ndetermine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can\x92t tell, what ever it was went\nback in too quickly.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, anyway, I got to go change, I\x92m ah, meeting some of the cast\nfor drinks.'"
Chandler:,b' Excuse me?'
Joey:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody\ncould be here with our chick!'
Joey:,b' Hey! Who was up from 2 o\x92clock this morning until 5 o\x92clock this\nmorning trying to get her back to sleep?'
Chandler:,b' You don\x92t think I get up when you get up?'
Joey:,"b' Ohhh, here it comes.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, here it comes! I\x92m stuck here all day, and then you come in\nand spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?\nWell I don\x92t think so mister!'"
Joey:,b' Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!'
Chandler:,b' And you don\x92t think taking care of our chick is work?'
Joey:,"b' That\x92s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...'"
Chandler:,"b' I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this\nchick, we\x92ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?'"
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know, maybe we weren\x92t ready to have a chick.'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92ll take her back tomorrow.'
Joey:,b' Do you think we\x92ll get our three bucks back?'
Ross:,b' (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in\nlike two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This\nblue suit, or this brown one?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the\nblue one.'"
Ross:,b' Really? (Joey gives him a \x91Like I would know\x92 look)'
Rachel:,"b' (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble\nopening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)'"
Ross:,b' Wow! That aspirin dance really works!'
Rachel:,b' (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!'
Ross:,"b' Oh my God, is that still...'"
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m fine, I\x92m fine.'"
Ross:,b' No you\x92re not.'
Rachel:,b' Yes I am! '
Ross:,b' Rach!'
Rachel:,"b' Look, I\x92m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)\nLook at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)\nWhoa-whoa!'"
Ross:,"b' (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a\ndoctor! Okay?'"
Rachel:,b' No. I have '
Ross:,"b' And I\x92m sure you\x92re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I\x92m\nRachel Green. It\x92s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands\nwith it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,\nyou probably have a broken rib!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it\x92ll still be broken\nthen.'"
Ross:,b' Rach...'
Rachel:,"b"" But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."""
Ross:,b' Rachel...'
Rachel:,"b' Look, either help me or go.'"
Ross:,b' Fine. I\x92ll go.'
Rachel:,"b' (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you\nhelp me first?'"
Ross:,b' (He checks his watch) Sure. I\x92ll help you.'
Chandler:,"b' (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out\nof a VCR?!'"
Rachel:,"b"" (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!\nWould you please, help me with this too?"""
Ross:,"b' Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He\ndoesn\x92t like how it tastes.)'"
Rachel:,b' (taking the brush back) Okay. Let\x92s use this brush. (Hands him\nanother one.)'
Ross:,b' Okay. This stuff? '
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,b' All right.'
Rachel:,"b' Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.\nOkay? Just sweep it.'"
Ross:,b' Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh-ho!'
Ross:,b' Sorry.'
Rachel:,b' Hey! That\x92s just poking me in the eye!'
Ross:,"b' Sorry, I\x92m sorry. Close, close, close...'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, just sweep it.'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m sweeping...'
Rachel:,b' Right.'
Ross:,"b' Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she\nhas a black eye.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, now make it even, \x91cause we don\x92t...'"
Ross:,b' What? What?'
Rachel:,"b' We don\x92t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.'"
Ross:,"b"" No. No, y'know you don\x92t, you don\x92t wear enough of this. (Rachel\nis shocked) What?"""
Rachel:,"b' Since when, since when do you think I don\x92t wear enough of this?'"
Ross:,"b' Well I, close your eyes, I just think you\x92re gonna like this a little\nbetter, \x91cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)'"
Rachel:,b' Blow it.'
Ross:,"b' (blows it) Sorry. \x91Cause umm, I think this will make you a little\nmore sophisticated.'"
Rachel:,b' Sophisticated like a hooker?'
Phoebe:,b' Hey! '
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, I have to tell you something.'"
Phoebe:,b' But I can\x92t tell you.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn\x92t tell,\nand I swore to like all my gods.'"
Phoebe:,b' No.'
Phoebe:,b' No.'
Phoebe:,"b' No, but let\x92s come back to that later!'"
Ross:,"b' There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?'"
Rachel:,b' Sure.'
Ross:,b' Yep?'
Rachel:,"b' Sure, I\x92ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.'"

Rachel:,"b' Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t want you to see me naked!'
Ross:,"b' Rachel, I\x92ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you\nnaked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but that was different. Y\x92know? I mean, we were, we were\ngoing out then, now I think it\x92s weird.'"
Ross:,"b"" Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want."""
Rachel:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!'
Rachel:,b' Ross! Stop that!'
Ross:,"b' Ah, I\x92m sorry.'"
Rachel:,b' Come on! I don\x92t want you thinking of me like that any more!'
