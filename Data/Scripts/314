Phoebe:,"b' Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that\nbefore.'"
Chandler:,b' I like her.'
Phoebe:,b' (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at\nthe same time?'
Chandler:,"b' Well, that\x92s pretty much all I\x92m looking for from these\npeople.'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know,\nshe\x92s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he\x92s dancing) y'know, and you\x92re\nmore (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)"""
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she\x92s done.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh no, one of those \x91look for the hidden meaning\x92 songs.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey Leslie, how\x92d you know I\x92d be here?'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the\nplace with the big fish comes up again. I\x92d like know whether that\x92s several big\nfish or just one big fish.'"
Joey:,"b' (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.'"
Phoebe:,b' Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.'
Joey:,"b' (to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hmm, bummer.'"
Phoebe:,b' No. But thanks.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. No. But thanks.'
Joey:,"b' (to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once\nyou betray me, I become like the ice woman, y\x92know. Very cold, hard, unyielding,\ny'know nothing, """
Chandler:,b' No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called\n\x91wait until the last moment before I burst and die.\x92'
Chandler:,"b' Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it\x92s a beautiful woman coming out\nof the men\x92s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?'"
Chandler:,"b"" (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I\x92m-I\x92m\ntalking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say\nyour name."""
Chandler:,"b' Ginger. I\x92m talking to Ginger, so.... '"
Chandler:,"b' Nope, nope, I\x92d just ah, I\x92d rather talk to you. (pause)\nYes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)'"
Phoebe:,b' Where\x92s Chandler?'
Joey:,"b' Ah, he can\x92t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh!\n(hides behind the coat rack.)'"
Joey:,"b' Phew, close one.'"
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,"b' Hi, sweetie!'"
Ross:,b' Hello. '
Ross:,"b' Yeah, huh. '"
Rachel:,b' I\x92ve got some bad news.'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.'"
Ross:,"b' Come on sweetie! You\x92ve had to work late every night for the past two\nweeks, what is it this time?'"
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that\x92s sad\nabout you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?'"
Rachel:,"b' Nooo, he\x92s leaving for a better job.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh well that\x92s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then.\nHuh? (picks a pad up off Rachel\x92s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.'"
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Well we\x92re gonna miss you around here.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, you bet.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the\noven)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.\nThat\x92s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our\nMoms worked on the barge together."""
Phoebe:,b' You '
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Phoebe and Monica:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Is ah, is Chandler around?'"
Joey:,b' Oooh.'
Joey:,"b' Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn\x92t something that sounded like\nGinger, like ah, Gingeer?'"
Joey:,"b' Aww, man. That\x92s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out\nhe\x92s my roommate, she\x92s gonna tell him what I did.'"
Joey:,"b' What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can\x92t, I can\x92t tell you that,\nit\x92s like the most awful, horrible thing I\x92ve ever done my whole life.'"
Joey:,"b' All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone\nout a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad\x92s cabin. Just me,\nher, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic\ndinner....'"
Joey:,"b' I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of\nthe fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.\nSo, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!'
Joey:,"b' I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should\x92ve told you\nabout Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.'"
Joey:,b' I ran!!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, that\x92s the best kiss I\x92ve had with anyone I\x92ve\never met in a men\x92s room.'"
Chandler:,"b' (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in\na puddle.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, we\x92re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, really you\x92re gonna freeze.'"
Chandler:,"b' You\x92re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?'"
Rachel:,b' Funny book?'
Ross:,"b' Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today.\nUmm, Mark, Mark saying \x91I\x92ll see you Saturday.\x92'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you\ndidn\x92t mind.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, no, no, no, it\x92s-it\x92s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, please tell me it\x92s not because I\x92m going with Mark.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, well...'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!!! Ross!!'
Ross:,"b' Well, I\x92m sorry, but ah, look if you\x92re not working with him\nanymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?'"
Rachel:,"b' Because, he\x92s my friend.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with\nMark?'"
Ross:,b' Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?'
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, you thought \x91See you Saturday\x92 was funny.\nLook honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff\nwith. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.'"
Ross:,b' Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.'
Rachel:,b' Really!?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you\nknow I could be a fashion..... monger.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried\nlook on his face) What?'"
Ross:,"b' What should I wear, now I\x92m all nervous.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" It\x92s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn\x92t\ncalled. Not that I even care, y'know."""
Phoebe:,b' You think you know me so well.'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s what I said.'
Phoebe:,"b"" I can\x92t. I can\x92t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her\nand then one day it was \x91Okay, bye Pheebs\x92 gone. Y'know what the saddest part\nis, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I\x92ve ever had in like\nall my lives."""
Phoebe:,b' (singing) I stepped in something icky.'
Phoebe and Leslie:,"b' (singing) Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile.\nSticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I\x92ll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.'"
Ross:,b' (to Rachel) I\x92m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm)\nYou\x92re so pretty. I love you.'
Rachel:,b' Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)'
Phoebe:,"b' (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,\nsmelly cat, it\x92s not your fault.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, yeah!'"
Phoebe:,"b' I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I\x92d be a millionaire by\nnow, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."""
Phoebe:,"b' That\x92s okay. All right, I\x92m gonna play song that\x92s\nreally, really sad. It\x92s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside\ndown to play it.)'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.'"
Chandler:,"b' Great. It was great. She\x92s ah, she\x92s great, great looking,\ngreat personality, she\x92s greatness.'"
Chandler:,"b' Joey told you about the leg, huh?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn\x92t have, but it\ndid. I mean I like her, I don\x92t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it\x92s\nlike \x91Hey, y'know what, where\x92s your leg?\x92 I mean I\x92m the smallest\nperson in the world aren\x92t I? I\x92m the smallest person in the world."""
Joey:,b' (entering from his bedroom) Morning.'
Chandler:,b' (to Monica) Actually he\x92s the smallest person in the world.'
Joey:,b' (to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin\x92 huh?'
Chandler:,b' It came up.'
Joey:,"b' Listen, I ah, I know it\x92s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find\nthat funny?'"
Ross:,b' (entering) So I nodded off a little.'
Rachel:,b' Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father\x92s boat didn\x92t\nmake that much noise when it hit rocks!'
Ross:,b' Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about\nstrappy backed dresses.'
Rachel:,"b' Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium\nlistening to Professor Pitstains and he\x92s \x91Hey everybody! Remember that thing\nthat\x92s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there\x92s this little bone we\ndidn\x92t know it had!\x92'"
Ross:,"b' First of all it\x92s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little\nbone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn\x92t fly.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah,\nblah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.'"
Ross:,"b"" Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I\nwonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, that is so...'"
Ross:,"b' No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an\nunusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake\nit off, thinking it\x92s alive and attacking him.)'"
Rachel:,"b"" Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with\nme this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn\x92t go with Mark?"""
Ross:,"b"" No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don\x92t know, I feel like lately, I\nfeel like you\x92re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new\npeople, and you\x92ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it\x92s dumb, but\nI hate that I\x92m not a part of it."""
Rachel:,"b"" It\x92s not dumb. But, maybe it\x92s okay that you\x92re not a\npart of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it\x92s like, I-I-I like\nthat you\x92re not involved in that part of my life."""
Ross:,b' That\x92s a little clearer.'
Rachel:,"b"" Honey see, it doesn\x92t mean that I don\x92t love you. Because I\ndo. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it\x92s-it\x92s for me y'know,\nI\x92m out there, on my own, and I\x92m doing it and it\x92s scary but I love it,\nbecause it\x92s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?"""
Ross:,"b' Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)'"
Chandler:,"b' No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?'"
Chandler:,b' No. No. I don\x92t think so.'
Chandler:,b' That\x92s-that\x92s my nubbin.'
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...\n(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?"""
Chandler:,"b' You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?'"
Phoebe:,"b' (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren\x92t coming. What? Where were you?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, don\x92t give me a reason to get mad, okay'"
Phoebe:,"b"" No, look, I told you that I didn\x92t want you to try and sell it, and\nyou just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably\nwould\x92ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I\ncan\x92t trust you then just forget it. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important\nthing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but\nwe won\x92t be partners. So what\x92s it gonna be?"""
Joey:,b' Yeah. You okay?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life\x92s gonna had you all\nkinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a\nnew song?"""
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (singing) \x91Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle\nwhore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.\x92 That\x92s all I have so far.'
Chandler:,"b' (entering, happily) Well hello!'"
Joey:,b' Where have you been?'
Chandler:,b' The doctor.'
Ross:,b' Is everything okay?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no\nwaiting.'"
Rachel:,b' What?!!'
Chandler:,"b' That was an obvious joke, and I didn\x92t think of it.\nWhy didn\x92t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!'"
