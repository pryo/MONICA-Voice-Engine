Joey:,b' (Voice Over) Previously on Friends.'
Ross:,"b' I mean, I don\x92t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.'"
Rachel:,b' You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you\x92ve\ngot a girlfriend?'
Ross:,b' Is this about Mark?'
Rachel:,b' (shocked) Oh my God.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, it\x92s not, it\x92s not.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,\nurrgh, maybe we should take a break.'"
Ross:,"b' Fine, you\x92re right. Let\x92s ah, let\x92s take a break, (goes to\nthe door) let\x92s cool off, okay, let\x92s get some frozen yoghurt, or something..\n(opens the door)'"
Rachel:,b' No. A break from us.'
Rachel:,"b' Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a\nbreak, I don\x92t want to take a break.'"
Ross:,"b' (on the phone) I\x92ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don\x92t,\ndon\x92t you think we can work on this? '"
Ross:,b' Who\x92s that?'
Rachel:,b' Nobody.'
Ross:,b' Is that Mark?'
Rachel:,"b' Umm, honey, look he just came over to....'"
Ross:,b' Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, we never actually got to dinner.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, we kinda broke up instead.'"
Rachel:,"b' (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it\x92s on the ceiling.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, but it\x92s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.'"
Rachel:,b' No.'
Rachel:,"b' No, no-no, it\x92s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised\nhow much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to\nmake it work.'"
Rachel:,"b' (on answering machine) Hi, it\x92s me. I\x92ve been trying to reach\nyou all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and\nMark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. '"
Ross:,b' Yeah!!'
Rachel:,"b"" Eh, I\x92m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I\ndon\x92t want to get back together over a machine."""
Ross:,b' Na-huh.'
Rachel:,"b' So, I love you.'"
Ross:,b' I love you.'
Rachel:,"b"" And y'know what, I\x92m gonna, I\x92m gonna go to bed now, but ah,\non my way to work tomorrow morning, I\x92m gonna stop by around 8:30."""
Ross:,b' Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)'
Rachel:,b' Bye.'
Ross:,"b' Chloe, Chloe how\x92s it coming?!!'"
Ross:,"b' Umm, oh, hey, I don\x92t know. How about a big one?'"
Ross:,"b' Well then a small one!! Listen, let\x92s, we kinda have to get going!'"
Ross:,"b' You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down\nand picks up a shoe)'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?\n(He\x92s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)\nWell it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! """
Ross:,b' Yeah! '
Ross:,"b' Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I\x92m feeling. Well.... (picks up\nher coat)'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between\ntheir faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind\nthe door) Rachel!!!!'"
Rachel:,"b' Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.'"
Rachel:,b' So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?'
Ross:,"b' Yes, you can, very much.'"
Ross:,b' (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.'"
Phoebe:,"b' The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.'"
Phoebe:,b' Now what is Fabutec?'
Phoebe:,b' Waxine!!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.'"
Phoebe:,b' God. Do think it really doesn\x92t hurt? \x91Cause how can they do\nthat?'
Phoebe:,b' They have the best stuff in there.'
Chandler:,b' Oh my God! Oh my God!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah. We figured when we couldn\x92t find you, you\x92d gone home to\nmake up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?'"
Ross:,"b' You think?! God, I, ah, I\x92m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?\nRachel\x92s all like, \x91I love you and, and let\x92s work on this.\x92 And all I\ncan think about is, \x91What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?\x92 when I tell\nher what I did.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more\nimportant question. How dumb are you?'"
Ross:,"b' What?! Look, we\x92re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How\nam I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?'"
Joey:,"b' Look, Ross look, I\x92m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,\njust not about stuff that\x92s gonna get you in trouble.'"
Chandler:,"b' He\x92s right. Nobody\x92s gonna benefit, and you\x92re just\ngonna hurt her.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, and there won\x92t be a relationship left to rebuild.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, but don\x92t you think....'"
Chandler:,"b' All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait\nuntil the timing\x92s right. And that\x92s what deathbeds are for.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the\nfootrest extended.)'"
Joey:,"b' All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn\x92t find out\nsome other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about\nthe trail?'"
Ross:,b' What trail?'
Joey:,b' (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The\ntrail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!\n(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I-I don\x92t think there\x92s any trail.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac\x92s\nsister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe\x92s\nfriends with Rachel. And that\x92s the trail, I did it!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen\nstrips to leg number one, '"
Phoebe:,b' Grasp one of the linen strips by its \x91easy grab tab\x92 and pull\nit off in one quick pain free motion.'
Phoebe:,b' Was it not pain-free?'
Phoebe:,"b' Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don\x92t\nseem to think it\x92s that bad.'"
Phoebe:,b' (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!'
Ross:,b' (entering) Chloe? Hi.. '
Ross:,b' You took my watch?'
Ross:,"b' Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?'"
Ross:,"b' Exactly. So you didn\x92t, didn\x92t mention anything to Issac right?'"
Ross:,"b"" You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we\nhaven\x92t actually met..."""
Ross:,"b' Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s the one. Listen, I don\x92t want to hurt her.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?'"
Ross:,"b' Actually, no, we\x92re not.'"
Ross:,"b' No, we\x92re not.'"
Ross:,"b' No, we\x92re not!!'"
Ross:,b' Right.'
Ross:,b' Fine. I just need to know that you\x92re not gonna tell your sister.'
Ross:,b' (entering out of breath) Jasmine? '
Ross:,"b' We met at Phoebe\x92s birthday party, I\x92m, I\x92m Ross Geller.'"
Ross:,"b' Yes, I did.'"
Ross:,b' Very bad.'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe\nyet?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, Jasmine, please, please don\x92t. I love my girlfriend very much,\nand I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?'"
Ross:,"b' Thank you, thank you.'"
Ross:,b' (angrily) Who\x92s your roommate?'
Ross:,"b' Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn\x92t say anything to\nRachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh!!'
Phoebe:,b' Ow!!!'
Phoebe:,b' We\x92re all right.'
Phoebe:,b' We\x92re all right.'
Chandler:,b' Off?!!'
Phoebe:,"b' For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever\nexperience.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, well I don\x92t think you can make that statement, unless\nyou\x92ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,\nthat\x92s all. I mean, come on, it\x92s just a little wax.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey\x92s arm and puts a\nstrip on it.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, that\x92s mature.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh-huh.'
Ross:,"b' (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!'"
Rachel:,b' I can\x92t talk to you. I can\x92t even look at you right now!'
Chandler:,"b' Nothing, nothing.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?'"
Ross:,b' Rachel?'
Rachel:,b' Just get away from me!'
Ross:,"b' No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?'"
Rachel:,b' A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!'
Phoebe:,b' Whe-where did he put it?!'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, you had sex with another woman!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not\ngrow at all yesterday.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.'"
Rachel:,"b"" (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! """
Ross:,b' No!!'
Rachel:,b' Just get out! Now!!'
Ross:,b' No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.'
Rachel:,b' Okay! All right! How was she?'
Chandler:,b' Uh-oh.'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' Was she good?'
Joey:,b' Don\x92t answer that.'
Rachel:,"b' Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let\x92s talk\nabout it!! How was she?'"
Ross:,b' She was...'
Joey:,b' Awful! Horrible!'
Chandler:,b' She was not good. Not good.'
Joey:,b' She was nothing compared to you.'
Ross:,"b' She, she was different.'"
Joey:,b' Ewwwww!'
Chandler:,b' Uh-oh.'
Rachel:,b' Good different?'
Ross:,b' Nobody likes change.'
Ross:,"b' What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.'"
Phoebe:,b' Should we do something?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.'"
Ross:,"b' I\x92m sorry, okay, I\x92m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,\nand this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,\nand all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.'"
Rachel:,"b' Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend\nleave? (Ross can\x92t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She\nwas in there, when I was in there?!'"
Ross:,"b' Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant\nnothing to me!'"
Rachel:,b' And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! '
Ross:,"b' Look, I didn\x92t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I\nthought we were broken up. '"
Rachel:,b' We were on a break!'
Ross:,"b' That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.'"
Rachel:,b' You think you\x92re gonna get out of this on a technicality?'
Ross:,"b' Look, I\x92m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our\nrelationship was dead!'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!'"
Joey:,"b"" Y'know what, I don\x92t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to\nopen the door)"""
Joey:,b' Why not?! (to Chandler) I\x92m hungry.'
Rachel:,b' God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!'
Ross:,"b' Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to\nmake sure that didn\x92t happen!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, that is so sweet. I think I\x92m falling in love with you all over\nagain.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more\nimportant things to worry about."""
Joey:,"b' Yeah, we\x92ll be fine.'"
Ross:,"b' Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then\nChandler and Joey convinced me not to.'"
Chandler:,"b' (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we\x92re never leaving,\never.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hi, it\x92s Phoebe. Listen someone\x92s gonna have to take my 9:00\nwith Mr. Rehack, \x91cause it\x92s like 9:15 now, and I\x92m not there.'"
Ross:,b' Don\x92t you realise none of this would\x92ve ever happened if I\ndidn\x92t think at that same moment you weren\x92t having sex with Mark?'
Rachel:,b' All right. Let\x92s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been\nable to forgive me?'
Ross:,b' (pause) Yes I would.'
Rachel:,"b' You\x92d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked\nwith me, and made love to me?'"
Ross:,b' (less sure) Yes.'
Rachel:,"b' You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....'"
Ross:,"b' (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,\nokay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because\nit\x92s, I mean it\x92s you.'"
Ross:,"b' What? Come on Rach, tell me what you\x92re thinking?'"
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m thinking, I\x92m gonna order a pizza.'"
Ross:,"b' Order a pizza like, \x91I forgive you?\x92'"
Joey:,"b' Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic\nmessage to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.'"
Phoebe:,b' We could eat the wax! It\x92s organic.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh great, food with hair on it.'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, not the used wax.'"
Chandler:,b' Because '
Ross:,"b' Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I\x92m kinda hungry myself.'"
Rachel:,"b' Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I\x92d like to order a large pizza.'"
Ross:,b' No anchovies.'
Rachel:,"b' With ah, extra anchovies.'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s okay, I\x92ll just pick \x91em off.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in\nthe sauce?'"
Ross:,"b' You can have the last piece, if you want.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.'"
Phoebe:,"b' They\x92re gonna get through this, aren\x92t they?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, come on, it\x92s Ross and Rachel, they\x92ve got too.'"
Joey:,b' You think I need a new walk?'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b"" Well y'know, I\x92ve been walking the same way since high school.\nY'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I\nneed a \x91take notice\x92 walk."""
Chandler:,b' Are you actually saying these words?'
Ross:,"b' What, now you\x92re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee\ntable) Look Rachel, I-I\x92m sorry, okay, I\x92m sorry, I was out of my mind. I\nthought I\x92d lost you, I didn\x92t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane\nmust I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don\x92t cheat right, I,\nthat\x92s not me, I\x92m not Joey!'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a \x91come on\x92\nlook.) Yeah, okay.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved."""
Ross:,"b"" Y'know what, y'know what, I\x92m-I\x92m not the one that wanted that,\nthat break, okay. You\x92re the one that bailed on us. You\x92re the one that, that\nran when things got just a little rough!"""
Rachel:,b' That\x92s....'
Ross:,b' That\x92s what?!'
Rachel:,b' That is neither here nor there.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, well here we are. Now we\x92re in a tough spot again, Rach. What\ndo you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do\nyou wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,\nstupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I\x92m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I\ncan\x92t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can\x92t see us\nthrowing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.'"
Rachel:,"b' No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don\x92t! You can\x92t\njust kiss me and think you\x92re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn\x92t work\nthat way. It doesn\x92t just make it better. Okay?'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, okay, okay.'"
Rachel:,b' (softly) I think you should go.'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,b' (softly) I really think you need to go now.'
Ross:,"b' (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said\nthere was nothing so big that we couldn\x92t work past it together...'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, what the hell did I know!'"
Ross:,"b' Look, look, there\x92s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,\n(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can\x92t imagine, I can\x92t imagine my life\nwithout you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your\nface, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her\nwaist) and, and....'"
Rachel:,"b' (crying) No. I can\x92t, you\x92re a totally different person to me\nnow. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now\nI just can\x92t stop picturing with her, I can\x92t, (Ross stands up and backs away)\nit doesn\x92t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It\x92s just changed,\neverything. Forever.'"
Ross:,"b' (crying) Yeah, but this can\x92t be it, I mean.'"
Rachel:,b' Then how come it is?'
Phoebe:,b' They\x92ve been quiet for a long time.'
Joey:,b' Maybe she killed him?'
Chandler:,b' Let\x92s go.'
Chandler:,b' (to Joey) Is that your new walk?'
Joey:,"b' (whispering) No, I really have to pee.'"
