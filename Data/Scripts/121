Joey:,b' How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?'
Rachel:,"b' Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only\nhave to pay for the stuff that you bought.'"
Ross:,"b"" I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already\nthrown caution to the wind."""
Chandler:,"b' Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is\nshaking behind the sofa)"""
Ross:,"b"" Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-\n(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."""
Ross:,"b"" What? It's, it's just a phase."""
Chandler:,"b"" Well, that's what we said about Joey..."""
Ross:,"b"" Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal."""
Rachel:,b' (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!'
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b"" Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b"" You're not an artist."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."""
Rachel:,"b"" (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."""
Rachel:,b' (Yawning) Nooo...'
Chandler:,b' How about Joey... Pepponi?'
Joey:,"b"" No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more\nneutral."""
Chandler:,b' Joey... Switzerland?'
Joey:,"b"" Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like\nI'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not."""
Chandler:,b' Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?'
Joey:,b' Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, it does not ring a bell with me...'"
Joey:,"b"" (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."""
Chandler:,b' Might wanna try Joseph.'
Joey:,"b"" Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!"""
Chandler:,"b' Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the\nFiddler on the Roof.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,b' What are you doing?'
Rachel:,"b' What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit\ncard?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica,\ny'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a\nweird obsession thing."""
Phoebe:,"b"" This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, """
Phoebe:,b' Lotsa things.'
Rachel:,b' Which one do you think she is?'
Rachel:,b' What does she mean?'
Phoebe:,"b"" I think she means (Imitates) 'You """
Rachel:,b' She could be you.'
Phoebe:,"b"" (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!"""
Rachel:,b' What? You just click when they click.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."""
Ross:,b' (Mortified) Hi.'
Joey:,"b"" Where've you been?"""
Ross:,b' At the vet.'
Chandler:,"b"" She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"""
Ross:,"b"" She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached\nsexual maturity."""
Joey:,b' (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.'
Ross:,"b"" She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."""
Chandler:,b' So what does this mean?'
Ross:,"b"" I'm gonna have to give him up."""
Joey:,"b"" I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"""
Chandler:,"b"" I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult\nalready?"""
Ross:,"b"" I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you\nknow it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."""
Joey:,"b"" Isn't there any way you can keep him?"""
Ross:,"b"" No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to\nsome... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."""
Joey:,b' How do you get a monkey into a zoo?'
Chandler:,"b"" I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a """
Ross:,"b"" Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be\none of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be\na pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,\nso that's a possibility."""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a\ntotal party zoo."""
Phoebe:,"b' Hey. We found her, we found the girl.'"
Chandler:,b' What?'
Joey:,b' Did you call the cops?'
Rachel:,b' Nope. We took her to lunch.'
Chandler:,b' Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.'
Ross:,"b"" What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a\nstealer."""
Ross:,"b' Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.'"
Chandler:,b' ...Take off their hats!'
Phoebe:,b' Popes in a '
Rachel:,b' No way. No way did you do this.'
Rachel:,"b"" Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I\nget to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)"""
Ross:,"b"" (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the\nothers) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who\nthis is harder on, me or him."""
Phoebe:,"b"" I'd say that chair's taking the brunt."""
Ross:,"b' Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, somebody will.'"
Joey:,b' (entering) You know there already '
Chandler:,"b"" You're kidding."""
Joey:,"b"" Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.\nYou'd think you would've known that!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, you'd think I would've."""
Joey:,b' Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?'
Phoebe:,b' ...Flame Boy.'
Ross:,b' Where exactly is your zoo?'
Ross:,b' Yes.'
Ross:,"b"" No-no, he's, he's very docile."""
Ross:,"b"" Well I, I don't know. Why?"""
Ross:,"b"" He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."""
Ross:,b' Why- why- why would he need a blade?'
Joey:,"b' We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...'"
Chandler:,"b"" ...He's in."""
Ross:,"b"" He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Where the hell've you been?"""
Rachel:,b' Are you drunk?!'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been\nup here, I've been worried..."""
Rachel:,b' Monica? Monica!'
Rachel:,"b"" Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if\nyou're gonna be showing up for work?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not\nyou!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the\ncredit card people."""
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay,\nbut don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."""
Ross:,"b' Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh!'
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San\nDiego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."""
Joey:,"b"" I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."""
Ross:,"b' Just, just say what you feel.'"
Joey:,"b"" Marcel, I'm hungry."""
Ross:,b' That was good.'
Rachel:,"b"" (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,\ny'know, something to, um, do on the plane."""
Ross:,"b"" Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."""
Ross:,"b"" Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits\nbeside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really\ngonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to\nme, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,\nMarcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two\nseconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."""
Joey:,"b"" Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."""
Joey:,b' Holden McGroin.'
