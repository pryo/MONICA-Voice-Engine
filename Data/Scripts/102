Phoebe:,"b' Oh, yeah! '"
Rachel:,b' Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. '
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,\ny'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd\ncomes out. """
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...\nthat's not why we bought the ticket. """
Chandler:,"b"" The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great\nthe show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're\nin the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. """
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time\nyou're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. """
Joey:,b' (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?'
Ross:,"b"" No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little\nangry? """

Ross:,b' (trying to ignore her) No. No. '
Ross:,"b"" Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in\nthe Ice Age. """
Ross:,b'Hi. '
Ross:,"b' You look great. I, uh... I hate that. '"
Ross:,"b"" Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,\nuh... """
Ross:,"b"" Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? """
Ross:,"b' Why- why are you here, Carol? '"
Ross:,b' Pregnant?! '
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's\nCompany where there's some kind of misunderstanding. """
Phoebe:,"b""...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) """
Joey:,"b' Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. '"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I\nrealised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)\n...now I wish I was dead. """
Phoebe:,"b"" She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already\nfluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! """
Chandler:,"b"" Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a\nchild's pillow. """
Phoebe:,"b"" Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're\nlike all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. """

Rachel:,"b' Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under\nthe couch cushions.) '"
Phoebe:,"b"" No, look, don't touch that! """
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to\nhim... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front\nof your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the\nring, which makes it so much harder... """
Joey:,"b"" Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"""
Phoebe:,b' Doy! Probably right before she lost it! '
Chandler:,"b"" You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... """
Rachel:,"b' I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the\nkitchen with... '"
Chandler:,b' ...Dinah? '
Rachel:,"b"" (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... """
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I am sorry... '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! '"
Chandler:,"b"" Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring\nin a lasagne... """
Chandler:,"b"" Boys? We're going in. """

Chandler:,"b' Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? '"
Rachel:,"b' Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? '"
Ross:,"b"" Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not\ncomfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. """
Phoebe:,b' She is so great! I miss her. '
Chandler:,"b' I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. '"
Ross:,"b' Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them\ntomorrow. '"
Rachel:,b' So what are you gonna do? '
Ross:,"b"" I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. """
Joey:,"b' .....Well, this is still ruined, right?'"
Ross:,"b"" I- I think they're great! I, I really do. """
Ross:,"b' Aw, Mom... '"
Ross:,b' Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) '
Ross:,"b"" (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise\nyou guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,\nhere's the deal.

Joey:,"b' Your folks are really that bad, huh? '"

Phoebe:,"b"" She's a waitress. """
Rachel:,"b' All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to\nleave.) '"
Chandler:,"b' Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents\nactually preferred. '"
Rachel:,"b' The lights, please..'"
Ross:,b' ...How long was I in there? '
Rachel:,"b"" I'm just cleaning up. """
Ross:,"b"" D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? """

Rachel:,b' A lot. '
Ross:,b' Mm. '
Rachel:,"b"" So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? """
Ross:,"b"" Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's\ngonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too\nterrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give\nBarry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... """
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? """
