Chandler:,b' Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!'
Joey:,"b"" How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn\nand slide."""
Chandler:,"b' You don\x92t turn and slide, you throw it out! I\x92m tired of\nhaving to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!'"
Joey:,"b' Look, we\x92re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own\nhands!'"
Chandler:,"b' All right, how about we, how \x91bout we sell it.'"
Joey:,"b' All right. But, you\x92re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet\nto reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as\ndecorations.)'"
Chandler:,b' (nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to\nJoey) They seem all right with it!'
Ross:,b' Who\x92s Chip?'
Ross:,b' The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?'
Ross:,"b' Monica, you\x92re so lucky! He\x92s like the most popular guy in\nschool!!'"
Ross:,b' (to Rachel) I was just leaving.'
Rachel:,"b' Good! \x91Cause I\x92ve got a product report to read, it\x92s like\neight pages, I hope I don\x92t fall asleep.'"
Ross:,b' Why? Did you write it?'
Rachel:,"b' (sees Chip\x92s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called.\nI wonder what he wants?'"
Ross:,"b' Well ah, actually...'"
Rachel:,b' (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another\nguy.'
Ross:,"b' Well, umm, why don\x92t you give him a call?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sure.'"
Rachel:,"b' (on phone) Chip! Hi, it\x92s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah,\numm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens)\nMonica Geller. (listens) Ohh.'"
Ross:,"b' (whispering in her ear) Oh, that\x92s right! He called to ask out\nMonica! That-that\x92s gotta be embarrassing! '"
Phoebe:,"b' (screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily)\nThank you, thanks.'"
Ross:,"b' (reading the newspaper) Hey, here\x92s a question; where did you guys\nget the finest oak East of the Mississippi?'"
Chandler:,"b' Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the\nland.'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m reading your ad.'
Joey:,"b' Looks good, uh?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' (reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine\nItalian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?'"
Rachel:,b' Why? I love that thing.'
Chandler:,b' You want it?'
Phoebe and Rachel:,b' Oh no.'
Chandler:,"b' Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!'"
Chandler:,"b' All right look, I\x92m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.'"
Joey:,b' What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.'
Chandler:,b' (looks at him) Nooo.'
Joey:,b' Oh. What do you do?'
Chandler:,b' I can\x92t believe you don\x92t know what I do for a living!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I actually don\x92t know...'"
Ross:,"b' Good, so do I'"
Rachel:,b' Something to do with numbers?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over\nand picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat\x92s eyes) Oh my God.'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' Nothing. Nothing.'
Joey:,b' What? What\x92s wrong?'
Phoebe:,"b' I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my\nMother.'"
Rachel:,b' You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!'
Phoebe:,"b' No, no-no, '"
Ross:,"b' Are you sure she\x92s in the cat, or have you been taking your\ngrandma\x92s glycoma medicine again?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No Dr. Skeptismo! I\x92m sure. First of all, okay, there\x92s the\nfeeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my\nguitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My\nMother\x92s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then\nnods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to\nthe cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an \x93Oh my God.\x94 gesture) Oh, I\nhaven\x92t seen this smile in 17 years!'"
Joey:,"b' (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe\x92s mom has got a huge peni...'"
Chandler:,b' (interrupting) Let it go!!'
Rachel:,"b' Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you\x92re going out with Chip\nMatthews?'"
Rachel:,b' Nooo! It\x92s not okay! I can\x92t believe you would want to after\nwhat he did to me!'
Rachel:,b' Monica! I couldn\x92t find him for two hours! He was having sex with\nAmy Welch!'
Rachel:,"b' I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay, that doesn\x92t help me, because we went to the same high\nschool.'"
Rachel:,b' (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!'
Rachel:,"b' (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) '"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah. Just, if it\x92s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go\nhave sex with another guy?'"
Ross:,b' So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?'
Joey:,"b' Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don\x92t think\nany of them are gonna work out.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not\neveryone is qualified to own wood and nails.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,\ntrying to get away! Just like when she was alive.'"
Ross:,"b' So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, I\x92m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to\nthe fact that there\x92s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she\x92s worried that\ny'know, she\x92s gonna, she\x92s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)\nWell, that\x92s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in\nthe other room."""
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I\x92m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I\njust spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica\x92s room)'"
Ross:,"b' So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe\x92s mom remind anyone of a '"
Ross:,"b' Come on, you-you can\x92t tell me you actually believe that-that\nthere\x92s a woman inside that cat!'"
Rachel:,b' I believe it.'
Ross:,b' No you don\x92t. '
Rachel:,"b' Yes, I do.'"
Ross:,"b"" No you do\x97y'know what, you\x92re not gonna suck me into this."""
Rachel:,"b' Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.'"
Ross:,"b' I do not always have to be\x97okay, okay. (starts to leave)'"
Rachel:,b' '
Joey:,b' Pretty nice?'
Chandler:,"b' You\x92ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, I, I really don\x92t think we need a canoe."""
Chandler:,"b' All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you\nget home, throw the canoe away!'"
Joey:,b' (to Peter) Good for you!!'
Rachel:,"b' (entering) You guys, you\x92re never gonna believe what I just found\ntacked up on a telephone pole! (She\x92s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?'"
Ross:,b' (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe\x92s mother also goes by the name\nJulio.'
Rachel:,"b' You guys, there\x92s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I\nmean, you know what that means?!'"
Joey:,"b' (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!'"
Rachel:,b' Do we have to tell her?'
Ross:,"b' Yes, we have to tell her!'"
Ross:,"b"" (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand)\nCrazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have\ndinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."""
Ross:,b' Thank you.'
Rachel:,b' I '
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he\x92s wrong."""
Chandler:,"b' Oh-no, he\x92s right.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,b' (pause) How\x92s that going?'
Phoebe:,"b' So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and\npurred.'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s so sweet. (pause) I\x92m gonna get some coffee. (gets up and\nleaves)'
Rachel:,b' Pheebs...'
Phoebe:,"b' I just feel so, uhh.....'"
Rachel:,b' All right!!'
Chandler:,b' I\x92m coming already!!'
Rachel:,b' Jeez!'
Rachel:,"b' Hello, Chip.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m great! I\x92m great. I\x92ve got a great job at '
Rachel:,"b' She\x92ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how\x92s umm, Amy Welch?'"
Joey:,"b' This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage\ncompartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I\ncouldn\x92t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It\nwas funny \x91til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can\x92t,\nI\x92ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.'"
Joey:,b' Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! '
Joey:,"b' Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!'"
Chandler:,b' OH MY GOD!!!'
Joey:,b' (still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! '
Chandler:,b' Are you all right?!'
Joey:,b' Yeah...'
Chandler:,b' (lets him out) What happened?!!'
Joey:,"b' (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn\x92t take the chairs!!'"
Chandler:,b' What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell\nis all of our stuff?!!'
Joey:,"b' Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn\x92t\nthink big enough to fit a grown man!'"
Chandler:,b' So\x97You got in '
Joey:,"b' I was tryin\x92 to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy\nagain, do you know what I\x92m gonna do?'"
Chandler:,b' BEND OVER?!!!'
Rachel:,b' Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.'"
Joey:,"b' (looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!!\nOh, no-no-no, here it is!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!'"
Rachel:,"b' (to Monica) So, how was your date?'"
Rachel:,b' Um-hmm.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh honey, I\x92m sorry.'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh! That\x92s so great!'
Ross:,"b' (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, they said uh, \x93You don\x92t have insurance here, so stop\ncalling us.\x94'"
Ross:,"b' (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn\x92t tell her?! (They all kinda\nshy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!'
Ross:,"b' Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all\nover the place.'"
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to\nrespect her decision. Right?"""
"Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel:",b' That\x92s a good call. Right.'
Ross:,"b' No! No! Look\x97Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel\nguilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.\nThis is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross,\nhow many parents have you lost?'"
Ross:,b' None.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, then you don\x92t know what it feels like when one of them comes\nback. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I\x92m wrong, who cares? Just be a\nfriend. Okay? Be supportive.'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,b' I don\x92t know what to say.'
Rachel:,b' You could.... say you\x92re sorry to her mom.'
Phoebe:,b' I think she would like that.'
Ross:,"b' (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs.\nBuffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you\nwere just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend\x92s\nmother.'"
Phoebe:,b' Thank you. We both forgive you.'
Rachel:,"b' So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to\nme. And you\x92re welcome to come back anytime.'"
Chandler:,"b' Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we\x92d really appreciate\nit. (Joey nods in agreement)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Come on, Mom, I\x92ll take you home.'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92ll go with you.'
Ross:,"b"" Oh! Y'know, I\x92ve got an extra futon."""
Joey:,"b' Dude, you don\x92t have to brag! We got nothing here!!'"
