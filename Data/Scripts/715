Rachel:,b' (starting to cry) Ohh\x85'
Ross:,b' What\x92s the matter? You okay?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s just y\x92know\x85'"
Chandler:,b' (To Ross) Monica said wedding.'
Rachel:,b' Oh! I would love to read a poem.'
Chandler:,b' Do you think you could get through a poem?'
Rachel:,b' (crying) It\x92ll be a short one.'
Rachel:,b' Ohhh\x85'
Ross:,"b' Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.'"
Chandler:,b' Too?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.'"
Ross:,"b' Sorry, I\x92m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type\nmanner.)'"
Joey:,"b' (entering, excited) Hey!'"
Joey:,"b' So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and\x85'"
Joey:,b' '
Chandler:,b' That\x92s great!'
Joey:,"b' And-and-and not only that, I\x92m gettin\x92 a new brain!!'"
Chandler:,b' So great things are happening at work '
Rachel:,"b' Wait, what do you mean you\x92re getting a new brain?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh well, they\x92re killing off one of the characters on the show, and\nwhen she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.'"
Ross:,b' What? A brain transplant?!'
Joey:,"b' (seriously) Yes, it\x92s a highly controversial procedure.'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s ridiculous!'
Joey:,"b' Well, I think it\x92s ridiculous that you haven\x92t had sex in three\nand a half months.'"
Ross:,"b' (to Monica and Rachel) It\x92s winter, they are fewer people on the\nstreet. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)'"
Joey:,"b' Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.'"
Joey:,b' Nice.'
Rachel:,"b' She is so good at throwing drinks in people\x92s faces, I mean I\ndon\x92t think I\x92ve ever seen her finish a beverage.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Chandler:,b' Don\x92t do it.'
Rachel:,"b' Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, tell me about it. And she\x92s been on the show forever, it\x92s\ngonna be really hard to fill her shoes.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain\ntransplant,"" you are going to be her?'"
Joey:,"b' Yes, but in Drake Ramoray\x92s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is\nthis so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?'"
Rachel:,"b"" (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay."""
Phoebe:,b' Yeah? Why?'
Rachel:,"b"" Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy."""
Phoebe:,b' Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an\nattractive man sitting at a table behind them.)'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight."""
Phoebe:,b' (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us\nfigure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)'
Rachel:,"b' All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, he left his cell phone.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."""
Phoebe:,b' Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.'
Rachel:,"b"" What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and\nI answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?\nKind of like a fairy tale for the digital age."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah\x85 That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both\nget up.)"""
Rachel:,b' What? Wait! Why\x85why do you get the story?'
Phoebe:,"b"" I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long."""
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.'"
Phoebe:,"b' That wasn\x92t a date! That was, that was just friends getting\ntogether\x85(quietly) having sex.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.'"
Phoebe:,b' No way! No way! You '
Rachel:,"b' Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn\x92t think I\x92d love\nagain.'"
Phoebe:,b' Nice try.'
Rachel:,b' Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t know. '
Rachel:,"b' Well umm, maybe we could uhh\x85 (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!! '"
Phoebe:,b' Ah-ha! Too cocky!'
Joey:,b' That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do\nthat?'
Joey:,"b' Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.'"
Joey:,b' Say what?'
Joey:,"b' No. No, I\x92m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.\nI-I\x92m the guy in the coma!'"
Joey:,"b' An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I\x92m getting your brain\nwhen you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me\x85'"
Joey:,b' (quickly) I don\x92t know. Why? Did you hear something?'
Joey:,"b' Oh uh, one of the writers.'"
Joey:,b' Umm\x85'
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Joey:,"b' Ms. Monroe\x85 (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving\nJoey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just\nreceived.)'"
Rachel:,"b' No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that\x92s not fair! Okay\nlook, I have an idea. Why don\x92t we, why don\x92t we see what kind of number he has\non his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And\nthen whoever does gets the phone.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t think so.'
Phoebe:,"b' (handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I\x92d bet you\x92d\nbe singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.'"
Rachel:,"b' (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is\nmom.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last\nblueberry muffin.'"
Phoebe:,b' Did I use that already today? I\x92m sorry.'
Rachel:,b' Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn\x92t\ntelling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T\nhat\x92s a steak house!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that\x92s one for you.'"
Rachel:,"b' (looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He\x92s got '"
Phoebe:,b' So you don\x92t know that\x92s '
Rachel:,b' (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!'
Chandler:,b' I think it\x92s the dying cat parade.'
Chandler:,b' (turning around and looking) Oh my God!'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was\nhanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You\x92re half\nScottish right?""'"
Chandler:,b' Yes!!'
Chandler:,b' Why is your family '
Chandler:,"b' If you listen very carefully, I think its '"
Rachel:,b' Hi Pheebs!'
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Rachel:,b' How are ya?'
Phoebe:,b' Good.'
Rachel:,"b' Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I\nwas going to keep the uh, the cute guy\x92s cell phone?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it\nrang I could just pick it up?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,b' And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, now you lost me.'"
Rachel:,b' You stole the phone!'
Phoebe:,b' No I didn\x92t!'
Rachel:,"b' No? So you\x92re saying that if I called it, it wouldn\x92t ring?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new\nringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe\x92s bag starts to ring.) Oh, it\ndoes work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe\x92s handbag.)'"
Rachel:,b' Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,b' That is a different phone.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy\x92s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her\nphone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.\n(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It\x92s for me!'"
Phoebe:,b' That is damning evidence.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God! I bet that\x92s him. My digital fairy tale is about to\nbegin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be\n(Happily) Hi! It\x92s Rach\x85 (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel\x92s hand,\ncatches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I\x92m the one who found your phone.'"
Rachel:,b' Phoebe! You can\x92t do th\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Rachel) Shhh! I\x92m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can\npick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It\x92s umm, it\x92s umm 5 Morton\nStreet, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y\x92know after we can grab a bite to eat or\nwhatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay I\x92ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)'"
Rachel:,b' You do know that I will be here when he comes over.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?'
Rachel:,b' You just said it!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just\x85be alone\ny\x92know to think about my mom and her suicide.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,b' What?! That\x92s the first time today!'
Rachel:,b' Ohh! (Exits.)'
Joey:,b' So you like the nachos uh? Myself I\x92m partial to\x85'
Joey:,b' See you in 2003. (She walks away.)'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the\nshow.'"
Joey:,b' No I mean it! I can\x92t believe they would do this to you! And to your\nfans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!'
Joey:,b' Joey.'
Joey:,"b' Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye\x97l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,\nthat I came up to you before was because well, I\x92m really nervous about-about being\nyou. Y\x92know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y\x92know?\nHelp me keep Jessica alive. Please?'"
Joey:,b' Oh that\x92s great! Oh thank you so much!'
Joey:,"b' Hey! Now, I\x92ve been watching some tapes, how\x92s this? (In a\nBritish accent.) ""Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again!\nEver!!""'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' (shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby\x92s going on my\nr\xe9sum\xe9!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I feel like a snack!'"
Chandler:,b' Oh no thanks. I don\x92t like '
Ross:,b' What?!'
Chandler:,"b' Well it\x92s just my entire family was run out of Scotland\nby\x85Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)'"
Ross:,"b' Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its\nScottish roots.'"
Ross:,b' Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more\x85'
Ross:,b' How did you know about that?!'
Chandler:,b' We heard you play all the way from your apartment!'
Ross:,b' Were you the ones called the cops?!'
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s not really important right now. What is important is;\nwhile we appreciate the gesture, we just don\x92t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our\nwedding.'"
Ross:,b' Why not?'
Chandler:,b' Because we hate them.'
Ross:,b' Come on that\x92s not fair! I mean you haven\x92t even heard me play!'
Chandler:,b' We '
Ross:,"b' No, you\x92ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to\nperform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I\x92m not going to tell you what\nsong I\x92m gonna play either. But uh, let\x92s just say when it\x92s over I\x92ll\nbet there will be a wee bit o\x92 celebration.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)\nAll right!'"
Joey:,"b' Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)'"
Joey:,"b' Oh well\x97Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.\nY\x92know? It\x92ll-it\x92ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different\ncharacters. You\x92re so talented.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey that\x92s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb\x97Angelina\nJolie!'"
Joey:,b' Like-like what?'
Joey:,b' (impressed) Wow!'
Joey:,"b' Oh hey come on, don\x92t-don\x92t-don\x92t do this! Umm, look\nlet-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I\x92m thinking,\n""Boy, she-she is a great actress!"" (She\x92s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am\nalso thinking, ""She is hot!""'"
Joey:,b' You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We\nshould probably get-get uh\x85'
Joey:,"b' Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that \x91cause she\x92s so passionate?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)'
Rachel:,b' Hey! Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?'
Rachel:,b' Well why shouldn\x92t I?!'
Phoebe:,b' Because it\x92s my apartment!'
Rachel:,"b' Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the\ncalls to China.'
Phoebe:,b' (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?'
Rachel:,b' (laughs) You\x92re not the man who left the cell phone.'
Rachel:,b' Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Could you-could you umm, give us one second?'"
Rachel:,b' We\x92ll be right back sir.'
Phoebe:,b' Wh-what do we do?'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know!'
Phoebe:,b' Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for\na hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!'
Rachel:,b' I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hmm, they just don\x92t '"
Rachel:,"b' (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to\nwait.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel, listen\x97I mean, if you let me have him then I will '"
Rachel:,"b' (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have\nhim, but you owe me; you owe me big!'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah! You\x92re such a great friend!'
Rachel:,b' Ohh\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Oh that\x92d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.'
Phoebe:,b' (whispering) Nice!'
Joey:,"b' Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.'"
Rachel:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am\nsuch a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!'"
Rachel:,b' (screaming) '
Joey:,"b' That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.'"
Joey:,b' (shrugs) Sure. Yep.'
Rachel:,"b' God. You seem really, really nice.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, bye-bye.'"
Rachel:,b' I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.'
Joey:,"b' All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the\napartment.)'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' You are so beautiful.'
Joey:,b' Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To\nCecilia) I-I am so sorry. I\x85'
Joey:,b' (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!'
Joey:,b' They sent me today\x92s script! They never send the script!'
Joey:,"b' Well no, I\x92m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes\nwhat that means.) Oh\x85'"
Joey:,"b' (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an\nelectric fence.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah well, I\x92m guessing after this she\x92s not going to be crazy\nabout electricity either.'"
Ross:,b' \x85now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.'
Rachel:,b' (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee\nsocks.'
Ross:,b' (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?'
Rachel:,b' No!'
Ross:,"b' (stands up) Now umm, remember I\x92m still learning.'"
Ross:,"b' One, two, three, four!'"
Ross:,b' You know the song! Sing along!'
Ross:,b' So?'

Joey:,b' Oh noo\x85'
Joey:,b' Thanks!'
Joey:,b' Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?!'
Joey:,b' The airport?'
Joey:,"b' Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s a really long time.'
Joey:,"b' Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.\n(Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again\x97That is\x97I tell ya, that is a\ntricky one!'"
Joey:,b' Good luck.'
Ross:,b' You know the song! Sing along!'
