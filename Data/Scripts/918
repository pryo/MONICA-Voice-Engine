Joey: ,"b'Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?'"
Joey: ,b'Alright!'
Joey: ,b'(abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.'
Joey: ,b'(even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.'
Joey: ,"b""Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't \n  sell tickets here in New York, so..."""
Rachel: ,"b""Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?"""
Joey: ,b'(hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.'
Joey: ,b'Uh!'
Chandler: ,"b""Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? \n  No thank you!"""
Phoebe: ,b'Hey will you get me tickets too?'
Rachel: ,"b""Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 \n  bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!"""
Ross: ,b'No thanks!'
Phoebe: ,"b""You don't wanna win the lottery?"""
Ross: ,"b'(in a mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of \n  my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.'"
Chandler: ,b'Still on Amelia Earhart?'
Ross: ,b'The woman just vanished!'
Joey: ,"b""Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"""
Ross: ,b'No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I \n  mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.'
Chandler: ,"b""Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck \n  by lightning 7 times."""
Joey: ,b'I like those odds!'
Ross: ,"b""Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 \n  dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."""
Chandler: ,"b""(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross) Boohaki?"""
Ross: ,"b""Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying \n  to be careful about what words we use in front of her."""
Rachel: ,"b'Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit \n  and brotherpucker.'"
Rachel: ,"b""Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what \n  I'm saying."""
Chandler: ,b'Kinda like Joey.'
Joey: ,"b""(who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?"""
Chandler: ,b'Pie eating contest?'
Chandler: ,"b'No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.'"
Ross: ,"b""(yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're towing your \n  car!!"""
Ross: ,"b""(panting)They're towing """
Joey: ,"b""(sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel \n  you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?"""
Rachel: ,b'Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were \n  there!'
Joey: ,b'(not yelling anymore)I was?'
Joey: ,b'I did?'
Rachel: ,b'She dropped off a casserole?'
Joey: ,b'Oh yeah! The casserole lady.'
Ross: ,"b'Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go \n  out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!'"
Chandler: ,"b""(hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, \n  I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"""
Ross: ,b'(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?'
Chandler: ,"b'(into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?'"
Rachel: ,"b""(to Monica)What's going on?"""
Joey: ,b'Ooh! Tough odds!'
Ross: ,b'(mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state \n  lottery!'
Joey: ,"b""(smiling)Look who's coming around!"""
Chandler: ,b'(still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when you know \n  more.'
Joey: ,b'(excited)Did you get it?'
Chandler: ,b'One of the slots got filled.'
Joey: ,b'(Still excited)By you!?'
Chandler: ,b'Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.'
Chandler: ,b'Yeah I know.'
Rachel: ,"b""Well, there's two spots left right?"""
Chandler: ,"b""Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, \n  I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie."""
Phoebe: ,"b""(excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! \n  I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!"""
Ross: ,b'(mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a \n  chance!'
Phoebe: ,"b""Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really \n  not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we \n  don't like to play with the carcasses!"""
Rachel: ,"b""Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over \n  my hands."""
Joey: ,"b""I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine."""
Phoebe: ,b'I hope I win!'
Joey: ,"b""I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't \n  come true!"""
Joey: ,"b""Can't really say!"""
Joey: ,"b""(slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with these questions!"""
"Rachel, Chandler and Monica: ","b'Please, just do it!'"
Phoebe: ,"b'One, two, three!'"
Joey: ,"b'I won, hey!'"
Ross: ,"b""You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you \n  guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs \n  lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing gets hot!!"""
Rachel: ,"b'You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna \n  feel if we actually do win?'"
Ross: ,"b""Uh, you're not gonna win."""
Rachel: ,"b'Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has \n  to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we\'re gonna \n  be all like ""oh everybody, let\'s take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you\'re \n  gonna be all like ""oh, I can\'t guys, I\'ll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas \n  up the Hyundai""'"
Ross: ,"b""Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that."""
Chandler: ,"b'I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners\' friend filled \n  with regret eats own arm"".'"
Ross: ,b'Why would I eat my own arm?'
Chandler: ,"b""Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever \n  we want."""
Ross: ,b'Why?'
Ross: ,"b""You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact \n  that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here (they \n  kiss and hug)"""
Phoebe: ,b'Get a room!'
Chandler: ,"b""Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"""
Ross: ,"b""I don't know, probably just invest it."""
Chandler: ,b'Ooh! Calm down ...'
Joey: ,"b""Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? """
Ross: ,"b'Oh, I\'m sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss \n  it all away"" (Joey and Chandler pleased)'"
Joey: ,"b'Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!'"
Rachel: ,"b""I don't really care about the Knicks."""
Joey: ,"b'Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.'"
Rachel: ,b'(touched) You would do that? I never get picked!'
Chandler: ,"b""You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."""
Joey: ,"b""You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're \n  taking this away from me!"""
Chandler: ,"b""You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."""
Ross: ,"b'(to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?'"
Chandler: ,"b""(looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?"""
Ross: ,"b'Oh, I\'ve gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when \n  we\'re around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...'"
Rachel: ,"b""I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first \n  word."""
Ross: ,"b'Although if we\'re gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" \n  too.'"
Phoebe: ,"b'Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"" (in a sexy tone)'"
Ross: ,b'I ... I was just talking about Rachel.'
Phoebe: ,"b'(still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy \n  gonna spank me?'"
Ross: ,"b""(tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad \n  gi .. (stops) no I can't."""
Chandler: ,"b'Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... \n  What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, \n  bye. (hangs up)'"
Joey: ,"b""Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?"""
Chandler: ,"b""Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."""
Chandler: ,"b""He's the boss's son."""
Rachel: ,"b'Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.'"
Rachel: ,"b'Ooh, I have another idea!'"
Phoebe: ,"b'Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?'"
Chandler: ,b'What about the ones you have on the nightstand?'
Chandler: ,"b'Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.'"
Chandler: ,"b'Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!'"
Rachel: ,"b'Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!'"
Phoebe: ,b'Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.'
Ross: ,"b""I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!"""
Ross: ,"b""3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ..."""
Joey: ,"b'I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did \n  you even get those?'"
Joey: ,"b""(to Ross) I'll show you how."""
Rachel: ,"b'Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? \n  How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?'"
Rachel: ,"b'Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?'"
Chandler: ,"b""(to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just \n  for us ..."""
Chandler: ,"b""Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look \n  like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, \n  the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)"""
Rachel: ,"b""All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last \n  you're gonna hear from us!"""
Rachel: ,"b""(surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my \n  share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!"""
Joey: ,"b""Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from Rachel)! And \n  I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"""
Ross: ,"b""Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win \n  I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."""
Phoebe: ,"b""Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together (takes \n  the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)"""
Joey: ,"b'Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all \n  thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)'"
Chandler: ,"b'Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!'"
Rachel: ,"b""Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! (she \n  tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his \n  nipple and she manages to take it)"""
Joey: ,b'(in pain) Oh!'
Phoebe: ,"b""(she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she starts running \n  around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!"""
Ross: ,"b'(trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!'"
Phoebe: ,"b""(keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine, \n  I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)"""
Rachel: ,"b'Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.'"
Joey: ,"b'No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in \n  the window)'"
Phoebe: ,"b""If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! \n  So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop \n  the tickets on the street)."""
Phoebe: ,"b""Don't come any closer!"""
Chandler: ,"b'Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting \n  squished...'"
Phoebe: ,"b""No, what's more important, your friends or money?"""
Phoebe: ,"b'Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?'"
Ross: ,b'Monica!'
Phoebe: ,"b'Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way \n  I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe who drops the \n  bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.'"
Ross: ,"b'Go, go, go!!'"
Phoebe: ,"b'What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking \n  for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.'"
Phoebe: ,"b'So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said \n  I was gonna win, remember?'"
Ross: ,"b""Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon..."""
Phoebe: ,"b""As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. (pause \n  ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish."""
Chandler: ,"b""(looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two messages. \n  These could be from work!"""
Chandler: ,"b'Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)'"
Phoebe: ,"b'Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.'"
Chandler: ,b'This is..shhh!'
Rachel: ,"b""Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra \n  over me at work."""
Chandler: ,"b'Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?'"
Rachel: ,"b'No, she was just much better at job than me!'"
Phoebe: ,"b'Guys, the drawing is about to start!'"
Rachel: ,"b""(To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's house and say \n  goodnight to Emma before she goes down."""
Ross: ,"b""Oh yeah, it's a good idea!"""
Chandler: ,"b""Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... \n  let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"""
Ross: ,"b""(on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, \n  you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel) Phoebe's totally \n  ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)"""
Rachel: ,"b'Hi mum, put her back on!'"
Joey: ,"b'(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on! They are \n  announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.'"
Chandler: ,b'I got that!'
Ross: ,"b'Oh, we have one too!!'"
Ross: ,b'(calling Rachel) Come on!!'
Rachel: ,"b'(on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but \n  I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to \n  my daughter?'"
Rachel: ,"b""(she goes towards the others and she's very excited) Guys, you're \n  not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her \n  first words!!"""
Joey: ,b'And what did she say?'
Rachel: ,"b'She said ""gleba""!! (she celebrates)'"
Rachel: ,"b""(to Ross) Isn't that amazing?"""
Ross: ,"b""Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"""
Rachel: ,"b""Why-why aren't you more excited?"""
Ross: ,"b'Oh, Rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word.'"
Rachel: ,"b'Oh, but of course it is!'"
Ross: ,"b'Okay, what does it mean?'"
Rachel: ,"b""I don't know all the words."""
Ross: ,"b""I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words \n  (goes back to checking the tickets)."""
Ross: ,"b'Yes you did, gleba is a word!'"
Ross: ,"b'Ok, use it in a sentence.'"
Rachel: ,"b'Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!'"
Ross: ,"b""It's not a word!"""
Rachel: ,"b""Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks \n  up the dictionary)."""
Ross: ,"b""Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said \n  another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt...."""
Rachel: ,"b'(searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... \n  (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain \n  fungi.'"
Ross: ,"b""She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head, very moved)"""

Joey: ,"b'(to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job. '"
Chandler: ,"b'Thanks, man.'"
Joey: ,b'And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.'
Chandler: ,b'Really? What?'
Joey: ,"b""Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win \n  the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."""
Chandler: ,"b""(smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, \n  worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out."""
