Phoebe:,b' What?! I thought you were crazy about her!'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before\nwe fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality\x97Well, they\x92re all\nback! Y\x92know? And she\x92s picked up like nine new ones!'"
Joey:,b' So what are you doing bringing her here?! There\x92s people here!'

Ross:,"b' Well, we didn\x92t have '"
Ross:,b' Cheers!'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were\ncomplaining though, was that they paid to hear the '"
Chandler:,"b' (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I\x92m just getting out of a very\nserious relationship\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.'

Joey:,b' Thanks for telling me!'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m only going to pretend I\x92m moving to Yemen, it\x92s the\nonly way I can get rid off her.'"
Joey:,"b' Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I know, I do that \x91cause it makes me look taller.'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!'"
Joey:,"b' Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can\x92t believe you said\nyou\x92d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, I can handle it! All right?'"
Rachel:,"b' Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.'"
Ross:,b' That\x92s \x91cause-\x91cause you\x92re mom\x92s dog kept-kept\nlooking at me.'

Ross:,"b' And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?'"
Joey:,b' Ross! (Laughs) They\x92re gonna kill you!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, why are you doing this anyway?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, you should\x92ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I\nmean, he\x92s like Joe Rugby.'"
Phoebe:,b' You\x92re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That\x92s so funny.\n(Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.'
Ross:,"b' Anyway, she thought the very '"
Rachel:,"b' (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I\x92m sorry. I\x92m sorry.\nYou\x92re right, you are a tough guy. You\x92re the toughest palaeontologist I know.'"
Joey:,"b' All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It\x92s not like\nhe\x92s\x85Chandler!'"
Chandler:,b' (from his bedroom) Thanks!'
Ross:,"b' Look, don\x92t worry about me. Okay? I\x92ll just stay real energetic\nand stay away from the ball. I\x92ll uh, I\x92ll be that guy right out of the circle.\n(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin\x92 at him.'"
Joey:,"b' Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy\n(Points). And that one\x97Dude! They\x92re all huge!'"
Ross:,b' They don\x92t look any bigger than me!'
Joey:,"b' Well, maybe that\x92s because you\x92re closer to you. So you look\nbigger to you from where you are.'"
Ross:,b' All right.'
Phoebe:,b' (to the player) Hi.'
Phoebe:,b' Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, I know what I have to do. I\x92ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and\nPhoebe don\x92t know what he\x92s talking about.) Y\x92know, Red Ross!'"
Joey:,b' I totally don\x92t know what you\x92re talking about.'

Ross:,b' JOEY!!!!!!'
Rachel:,"b' You\x85are\x85not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,\nand guess what happened?'"
Rachel:,b' No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.'
Rachel:,b' (refers to the table) What are these?'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! If only more people knew.'
Chandler:,"b' Y\x92know you, really didn\x92t have to take me to the airport.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, we\x92re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this\nis uh, good-bye then.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay. Then I guess it\x92s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign\nthat says, Wait Here."") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.'"
Chandler:,b' What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?'
Chandler:,"b' No. All right, y\x92know what, she\x92s (Points to Janice) gonna\nthink that I\x92m handing you a credit card, but what I\x92m really gonna do is hand\nyou a library card.'"
Chandler:,b' (to the ticket agent) '

Ross:,"b' Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!'"
Ross:,"b' (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle\nof water? '"
Ross:,b' Thanks. (When she\x92s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I\x92m\ndying. I really do. '
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, poor baby.'"
Ross:,"b' (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)\nExcellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!'"

Joey:,"b' Dude, if you go back out there, you\x92re gonna be Dead Ross!'"
Ross:,b' I don\x92t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!'
Ross:,"b' No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.'"

Joey:,b' The Red Ross! Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren\x92t there\noriginally.) What-what are-what are these?'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Look at this!'
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t care! The wires have come loose in your head!'
Rachel:,b' And did you?!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God.'
Rachel:,"b' Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Now, are you sure you don\x92t want to go see a doctor?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh no! That-that\x92ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I\nwas great! This is a great day! Y\x92know what? I\x92m buying everyone coffee. All\nright? If someone would just grab my wallet, it\x92s in my pocket. '"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, sure.'"
Ross:,"b' No, not you. (Emily gets it.)'"
Joey:,"b' Uhh, look, your eye\x92s still popping out a little, I\x92m gonna go\nget some ice.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and\nthe ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, I kinda was, wasn\x92t I?'"
Ross:,"b' I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven\x92t done that since I\nwas four and I washed my dad\x92s Porsche with rocks.'"
Ross:,"b' Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody\nnose\x97I mean I-I\x92m not proud of it but, I really am. And it\x92s all because of\nyou, wonderful, amazing you.'"
Ross:,"b' No, no, I\x92m serious. Thank you.'"
Ross:,"b' It\x92s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y\x92know what,\nyou know what? It\x92s not.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I-I guess I gotta go.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. '"
Chandler:,b' No!'
Chandler:,"b' Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and\nalso-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I then guess I\x92m going to Yemen! I\x92m going to Yemen!\n(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?'"
Rachel:,b' Thank God.'
Phoebe:,b' See? I\x92m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops\nworking.) I lost it.'
