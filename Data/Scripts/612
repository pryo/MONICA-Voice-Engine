Ross:,"b' Hey, you\x92re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it\nin to '"
Phoebe:,b' I didn\x92t know '
Ross:,"b' Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It\x92s not\njust about the pictures.'"
Chandler:,b' That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.'
Ross:,b' What?'
Chandler:,b' I made that joke up.'
Ross:,"b' Uh, oh-oh, no you didn\x92t. I did.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest\njoke he\x92d ever heard.'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, tell Dan, \x91Thanks.\x92'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is\nfunny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?'"
Chandler:,b' Seriously?'
Ross:,"b' Look, Chandler, it\x92s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any\nbetter they don\x92t print the name, so it doesn\x92t really matter who gets credit,\nright?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I guess.'"
Joey:,b' (entering) Hey guys.'
Ross:,"b' No, it\x92s my joke, it\x92s mine. You can call them, they\x92ll\ntell you.'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s my joke.'
Ross:,b' It\x92s my joke.'
Joey:,"b' Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,\nright?'"
Chandler:,"b' Dude, you have got to turn on '"
Joey:,b' Let\x92s go watch it at your place.'
Chandler:,"b' Nah, Monica\x92s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don\x92t\nwant to miss when they were skinny.'"
Joey:,"b' Chandler, Chandler, y\x92know what we should do? You and I should go out\nand get some new sunglasses.'"
Chandler:,"b' What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the\nscreen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?'"
Joey:,"b' No, that\x92s '"
Chandler:,"b' Joey, why is your cable out?'"
Joey:,"b' I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven\x92t really paid the bill'"
Chandler:,"b' If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some\nmoney?'"
Joey:,"b' No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a\nlittle tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. '"
Chandler:,b' Whoa ho.'
Joey:,"b' I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to\nthe radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the '"
Chandler:,"b' (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer\nwill let us watch the show at his place?'"
Joey:,b' Sure.'
Chandler:,"b' (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone\nbill?'"
Joey:,b' Not so much.'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Phoebe:,b' Wh-wh-what are you doing?'
Rachel:,b' We are looking at a '
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a\npicture). Yikes!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has\nlost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she\x92s crying out, \x91Where are\nthey, where are they?\x92'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,\nlift up your shirt, and bend over?'"
Rachel:,"b' You see, now, I would date this girl. She\x92s cute, she\x92s\noutdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that\x92s got to come in\nhandy'"
Rachel:,b' (thinks) I don\x92t know.'
Phoebe:,b' Rachel.'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t know. (Pause) Me neither.'
Joey:,b' You forget how many great songs Heart had.'
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.'"
Chandler:,"b' So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but\nI\x92m not even sure I got it.'"
Ross:,"b' What, you didn\x92t get it? The doctor is a monkey.'"
Chandler:,b' And monkeys can\x92t write out prescriptions.'
Chandler:,"b' (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.'"
Ross:,"b' Your joke? Well, I think \x91the Hef\x92 would disagree, which is why\nhe sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.'"
Chandler:,"b' So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I\x92ll show\nthe sexy teller that I am a published writer.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,"b' Well, I\x92m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).'"
Chandler:,b' Okay (he goes to sit down).'
Joey:,"b' Ah, Gunther, I can\x92t pay for this right now because I\x92m not\nworking, so I\x92ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin\x92 for stuff.'"
Joey:,"b' Uh, I don\x92t know. Ya see, it\x92s just, see I was a regular on a\nsoap opera y\x92know? And to go from that to this, I just\x85 Plus, I\x92d have to\nwait on all my friends.'"
Joey:,b' What?!'
Joey:,b' Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?'
Chandler:,"b' You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross\ndid? He stole my joke. You know what? I\x92m going to get a joke journal. Y\x92know?\nAnd document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' Picking Rachel.'
Chandler:,b' Maybe it\x92s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing\nmy thoughts.'
Joey:,b' (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back\nto bed.)'
Rachel:,"b' Monica, what are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,b' I guess it was kinda funny.'
Phoebe:,b' Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than\nyou is just that you\x92re \x85 just \x85 kinda high maintenance\x97Okay\nlet\x92s go to lunch!'
Phoebe:,"b' No, okay, you\x92re right. You\x92re easy-going. You\x92re just\nnot as easy-going as Rachel. She\x92s just more flexible and-and mellow. That\x92s\nall.'"
Rachel:,"b' (To Monica) Well, people are different.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ya, you know, Rachel \x85 she\x92ll do whatever you want.\nY\x92know, you can just walk all over her.'"
Rachel:,"b' What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I\x92m a pushover?\nI\x92m not a pushover.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay, (laughing) you\x92re not a pushover.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my \x85 you think I\x92m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you\nknow what? You\x92re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think\nthat\x92s pretty strong, that\x92s what I think. Come on, Monica, let\x92s go to\nlunch. (She leaves)'"
Rachel:,b' I cannot believe her.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.'"
Ross:,"b' (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this\nout.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, \x91cause I\x92m heading\nup there.'"
Ross:,"b' Uh, yeah, I\x92ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.'"
Joey:,b' Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? \x91Cause I\x92m going up there. '
Rachel:,b' No.'
Joey:,"b' (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, \x91cause I\x92m\nheading up there. '"
Joey:,b' You got it.'
Joey:,b' Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a \x91what\x92s wrong with\nyou?\x92 look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, honey, I don\x92t think you\x92re supposed to go back there.'"
Joey:,"b' Nah, it\x92s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they\x92re in\non a secret together.)'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, but I don\x92t see you asking any other paying customers to put on\naprons. '"
Joey:,b' No.'
Joey:,b' Yeah?'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s kind of embarrassing, y\x92know. I mean, I was an actor and\nnow I\x92m a waiter. It\x92s supposed to go in the other direction.'"
Chandler:,b' So is your apron. You\x92re wearing it like a cape.'
Joey:,"b' I mean, the job\x92s easy and the money\x92s good, you know? I guess\nI\x92m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I\njust feel kind of weird serving you guys.'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, I guess it doesn\x92t seem that weird.'"
Ross:,"b' Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven\x92t gotten it.'"
Joey:,"b' See, now it\x92s weird again.'"
Chandler:,"b' I think it\x92s great that you work here. You\x92re going to make\na lot of money, and here\x92s your first tip: Don\x92t eat yellow snow. (He laughs,\nthen picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15,\ncoffeehouse.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass\non my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the\ncoffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long\nway. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.'"
Joey:,"b' Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y\x92know? Now, how\nabout clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It\x92s all about turnover.'"
Ross:,"b' Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry, Ross. I\x92ll get it for you right now. And since I\nmade you wait, I\x92ll toss in a free muffin.'"
Rachel:,b' Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,"b' Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.'"
Phoebe:,"b' That true, I am flaky.'"
Rachel:,"b' So, what, you\x92re just, you\x92re just okay with being flaky?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, totally.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s great. Good for you guys.'
Rachel:,b' I am not a pushover!'
Phoebe:,b' Who said you were?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, I\x92m flaky. I\x92ll say anything.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.'"
Joey:,"b' Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it\x92s a great part.\nLook, check it out. I\x92m the lead guy\x92s best friend and I wait for him in this\nbar and save his seat. Listen-listen. \x91I\x92m sorry, that seat\x92s saved.\x92'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, man, I could totally get that part. \x91I\x92m sorry, that seat is\ntaken.\x92'"
Joey:,"b' No, no, I didn\x92t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?'"
Joey:,"b' So, you\x92d hire me, right?'"
Joey:,"b' Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be\nclosed for about an hour. '"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, it\x92s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It\x92s a very\nimportant issue in this month\x92s '"
Ross:,b' It\x92s my joke.'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s my joke.'
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, I don\x92t think we\x92re going to settle this.'"
Chandler:,b' Let\x92s have Monica decide.'
Ross:,b' Yeah!'
Chandler:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,b' Hey Mon.'
Chandler:,"b' Mon, get out here!'"
Ross:,"b' Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.'"
Chandler:,b' Because you\x92re the only one that can be fair.'
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, but I\x92m your brother. We\x92re family. That\x92s the most\nimportant thing in the world.'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Ross) Don\x92t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I\x92m\nyour only chance to have a baby. Okay, let\x92s go.'"
Ross:,b' We\x92ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide\nwhich one of us is telling the truth\x97me. '
Chandler:,"b' Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.'"
Chandler:,b' Can I finish my story?!'
Ross:,"b' See, I would never snap at you like that.'"
Chandler:,"b' So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve\x92s\ndoctor\x92s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, \x91Doctor Monkey?\x92 And that is how\nthe whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his\npoint.)'"
Ross:,"b' Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?\nMonkey into man? Plus, I\x92m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I\x92m Doctor Monkey!'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92m not arguing with that.'
Ross:,b' It\x92s your joke.'
Chandler:,b' Is not.'
Chandler:,"b' Hi, oh hi.'"
Chandler:,"b' (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,\ntogether lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be\nperceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and\x97(He falters and\nMonica prompts him.)\x97generosity of spirit.'"
Rachel:,"b' Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I\x92ve ever\nheard.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really? I\x92ve heard better.'
Chandler:,b' (To Chandler) I\x92m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing\nagain?'
Chandler:,b' (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You\x92re a little\nhigh maintenance.'
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m sorry. You\x92re not easy-going, but you\x92re\npassionate, and that\x92s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think\nthat I\x92m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that\x92s good\ntoo. So, they can say that you\x92re high maintenance, but it\x92s okay, because I\nlike \x85 maintaining you.'"
Chandler:,b' (happily) I\x92m off the list. (Sits on the couch.) '
Chandler:,"b' Hey, buddy boy, how\x92d the audition go?'"
Joey:,"b' Not good, no. I didn\x92t get the part, and I lost my job here, so\n\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! That is a bad audition.'
Rachel:,b' How-how did you lose your job here?'
Joey:,"b' Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in\ncharge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.'"
Rachel:,"b' He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left\nyou in charge when you\x92ve been working here two days? That\x92s not, that\x92s\nnot right.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, what are ya gonna do?'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, you can\x92t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I\x92m\nnot going to let him get away with that. I\x92m going to say something to him\x97No, I\nreally shouldn\x92t say anything\x97No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the\ncounter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you\nhave to fire him\x85'"
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' That\x92s right, he can have his job back. I\x92m glad we got that\nall straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s great. Thanks Rach.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who\x92s a pushover?'"
Phoebe:,"b' (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you\x92re in my seat.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I\x92m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, well, I kinda thought.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b' Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the\nother two guys to go out with, who would you pick?'"
Ross:,b' No way. '
Joey:,b' I\x92m not answering that.'
Chandler:,b' Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I\x92m not answering\nthat.'
