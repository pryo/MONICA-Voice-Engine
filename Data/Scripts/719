Phoebe:,b' (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?'
Joey:,"b' I\x92m sorry, do I know you?'"
Phoebe:,b' What are you doing?'
Joey:,"b' Nothing, I\x92m just practicing blowing you off because I\x92m gonna\nbe a big movie star!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh! You got it?!'
Joey:,"b'  Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, it\x92s this big budget period movie about these three Italian\nbrothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It\x92s really classy! Oh,\nand the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.'"
Phoebe:,b' The next next?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, there\x92s this guy from Chicago who\x92s supposed to be the\nnext Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy\x92s right after him. (Joey\x92s\ncell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!'"
Joey:,b' (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!'
Joey:,b' (on phone) Oh my God!'
Joey:,"b' Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh.\n(Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)'"
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s the matter?'
Joey:,b' They want me to be totally naked in the movie!'
Joey:,b' I know! My grandmother\x92s gonna see this!'
Phoebe:,b' Grandma\x92s gonna have to get in line.'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?'"
Ross:,b' A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman\nin America.'
Phoebe:,b' Sure.'
Ross:,b' Cassie?'
Ross:,"b' Wow, I haven\x92t seen her for, like, forever. I wonder if she still\ncarries that '"
Ross:,b' So what! I still have\x97No you\x92re probably right.'
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hi!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Phoebe:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,b' (laughs) Well okay\x97Well don\x92t ruin it! Just play along at\nleast!'
Rachel:,b' (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know! It\x92s not like it\x92s porn! This is a serious,\nlegitimate movie. Y\x92know? And the nudity is really important to the story.'"
Joey:,b' You\x92re right. Maybe I shouldn\x92t even go on the call back.'
Joey:,b' Well that\x92s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds\nreally great. My character\x92s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who\nrun away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and\nundress each other and hold each other. It\x92s really sweet and-and tender.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, when can we have this shower?'"
Rachel:,b' She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have\nFriday\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Well that\x92s only two days away. What is the other option?'
Rachel:,b' Yesterday!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We\x92re done!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We can\x92t do this by Friday!\nWe have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There\x92s just\ntoo much to do! It\x92s impossible! We can\x92t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do\nit!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Rachel, calm down!'"
Rachel:,"b' (calmly) Okay. I\x92m sorry. You\x92re right, you\x92re right.'"
Phoebe:,b' (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!'
Rachel:,"b' Phoebe, I already, I already did.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get\norganized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast\ndecisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh, here. What time?'"
Rachel:,b' 4 o\x92clock. Food?'
Phoebe:,b' Finger sandwiches and tea.'
Rachel:,b' Ooh great! Very Monica.'
Phoebe:,b' And chili!'
Rachel:,"b' Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?'"
Phoebe:,b' Both!'
Rachel:,b' We\x92re paying for this y\x92know.'
Phoebe:,b' Neither.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?'"
Phoebe:,b' Lusts of the flesh.'
Rachel:,b' (pause) What?'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know I\x92m-I\x92m really glad we decided not to sleep\ntogether before the wedding.'
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know I was thinking if we had a\x85a big fight and uh we\nbroke up for a few hours\x85'
Chandler:,"b' Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and\ndomineering?!'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s me! Come on!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.'"
Chandler:,b' (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!'
Chandler:,b' I\x92ll be right with you.'
Ross:,b' What\x97why?'
Ross:,"b' What?! Chandler, she\x92s our cousin!'"
Chandler:,b' I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.\nIt\x92s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica\x92s eyes.)\nSay something.'
Ross:,"b' Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even\nlook like now.'"
Chandler:,"b' Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, I\x92m back!'"
Joey:,"b' Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh great! Y\x92know I would\x92ve been perfect for this part, but\nwhatever! Y\x92know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!\n(Starts to leave.)'"
Joey:,b' And scene! Huh? Wasn\x92t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!\nOkay! So you-you-you-you were saying?'
Joey:,b' Wow! Sure! That\x92s great!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it\x92s handled tastefully and that barn\nis not too cold.'"
Joey:,b' So\x85What?'
Joey:,b' Yes!'
Joey:,b' No. What?'
Joey:,b'  Barmitsvahed?'
Joey:,b' Nope.'
Joey:,b' Yep.'
Joey:,b' That\x92s right.'
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter\nwhat you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse,\nyou tell \x91em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.'"
Joey:,b' I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet\nthe director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.'
Joey:,b' I just have to call my agent and tell her I can\x92t do the part. (Gets\nup for the phone.)'
Joey:,b' Unless what?'
Joey:,b' Like what?'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! I\x92ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,\nwe get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone\x92s names in them and inside is\neveryone\x92s individual birth stone.'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party\nis tomorrow and we still don\x92t have a guest list.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that\x92s coming? Me. Are you?'"
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey! What\x92s up Mon?'
Rachel:,b' Have at it.'
Rachel:,b' Are you makin\x92 him a sandwich?'
Rachel:,"b' (To Phoebe, after Monica\x92s gone) We have to get her a present?!'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay but look! Look at what I got! It\x92s her address book! (Holds it\nup.) We have a guest list!'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God you\x92re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?'
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)'"
Ross:,b' (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!'
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b' Oh. Oh, that\x92s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed\nlike you didn\x92t.'"
Ross:,"b' It\x92s okay. Come, come on in.'"
Ross:,b' Oh.'
Ross:,"b' Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah\x97No!!'
Ross:,"b' Cassie, how you-how you doin\x92 on that\x85hot dog.'"
Ross:,b' (quietly) Thank God.'
Ross:,"b' Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and\ntickled you \x91til you cried? (She laughs) We\x92re probably too old to do that now.'"
Ross:,b' (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I\x92ll\nalways remember that summer because that\x92s when I realized that we are related.'
Ross:,"b' Well I\x92m, I\x92m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children\nwould be.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of\nwomen.) Hi, thanks for coming.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to\nanother pairing.) Oh, it\x92s so nice to see you.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,b' Who the hell are all these people?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, I don\x92t know. I called all the people in Monica\x92s phone\nbook and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hmm, y\x92know there\x92s another word for people like\nthat: Losers!'"
Rachel:,b' (to her) Hi! I\x92m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I\x92m the maid of\nhonor. How do you know Monica?'
Rachel:,b' Ohhhh!'
Rachel:,b' That\x92s great!'
Rachel:,b' (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You\ndidn\x92t tell her to come?!'
Phoebe:,b' You were supposed to tell her!'
Rachel:,"b' No I wasn\x92t! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was\nsupposed to bring the cake!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Fine, I\x92ll go call her.'"
Rachel:,b' Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!'
Joey:,b' Wow! This looks great!'
Joey:,b' And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?'
Joey:,b' Thank God!'
Joey:,b' Ah.'
Joey:,b' Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)'
Joey:,"b' Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.'"
Joey:,b' Ow!'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' The fruit roll up.'
Joey:,b' Delicious.'
Joey:,b' Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!'

Rachel:,"b' Oh Monica, we are so sorry.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.'"
Phoebe:,b' And then for forgetting to invite you to it.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people\ncame, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now\nyou don\x92t have either.'"
Phoebe:,b' We ruined everything.'
Rachel:,b' Ugh\x85'
Rachel:,"b' What do you, what do you mean?'"
Rachel:,b' Surprise\x85'
Phoebe:,b' Sur-surprise.'
Rachel:,b' \x85Monica.'
Joey:,"b' And what\x92s cool is, the character is from Naples, right? '"
Joey:,b' My whole family\x92s from Naples!'
Joey:,"b' Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I\ntotally understand. You need to y\x92know make sure I don\x92t have any horrible scars\nor tattoos. Don\x92t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands,\nback up and looks down.) So there you go, that\x92s me. (We cut to a camera angle\nlooking at the casting director and movie director through Joey\x92s legs.) One hundred\npercent natural! (Suddenly, there\x92s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is\nshocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! No problem!
