Joey:,"b' Well Ross was hangin\x92 out over at our place, Rachel comes over to\nborrow some moisturiser from Chandler....'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to\nborrow something.'"
Joey:,b' Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.'
Phoebe:,b' Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He\x92s the one who slept with\nsomeone else. '
Joey:,"b' Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,\nthat she should of forgiven him by now.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what\nhe means. Oh my God, this is like '"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.\nMan, I hope Ross doesn\x92t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they\nnever broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."""
Joey:,b' I had the same dream!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. '"
Joey:,"b' Oh, I had the opposite dream.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what maybe it\x92s gonna be okay, I mean it\x92s been a\nweek."""
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I mean it\x92s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.'"
Rachel:,b' Closer than here?'

Rachel:,b' Ohh!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, it\x92s okay. (starts to leave)'"
Joey:,"b' Rach, it\x92s, it\x92s ah, it\x92s not that we don\x92t want to,\nreally. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?'"
Rachel:,b' And heels.'
Joey:,"b' (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,\nChandler mouths \x91Come on!\x92) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and\nwe set that night aside.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that\x92s only fair. (leaves)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.'"
Joey:,b' Oh yeah.'
Phoebe:,b' Chandler what are you doing?!'

Joey:,b' You\x92re smoking again?!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I\x92m,\nI\x92m smoking still.'"
Phoebe:,b' Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?'
Chandler:,"b' Look, I\x92m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which\nis when I started smoking in the first place.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeahhh. I\x92m tellin\x92 ya something, that ah, first smoke after\nnap time....'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh that\x92s great, with my luck, that\x92s gonna be him.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Him? Him, Ross?'"
Chandler:,"b' Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got\ndivorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and\nit\x92s Rachel again.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my\nsister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.\nHuh? I\x92m asking you first, right?!. I mean I\x92m playing by the rules.'"
Rachel:,b' Chandler! You\x92re smoking? What are you doing?!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, shut up!! You\x92re not my real Mom!!'"
Joey:,"b' (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can\ncut glass over here!'"
Phoebe:,b' Wait. Really?! \x91Cause mine get me out of tickets.'
Ross:,"b' Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending\nthis time with me. It\x92s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say\nthanks.'"
Chandler:,b' Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.'
Ross:,"b' Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon\nokay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an\nIrish accent) Two days of darts, it\x92ll be great!'"

Ross:,"b' So, for the whole weekend?'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, that\x92s okay, I mean if you guys '"
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know what, I can stay, I\x92m gonna stay. \x91Cause the last time\nI went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."""
Joey:,"b"" Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your\ngrandmother\x92s cab, but y'know what, I\x92ll stay."""
Ross:,b' What a pity stay?'
Ross:,"b"" Pity food? Y'know what that\x92s okay, all right, I don\x92t need any\nof you to stay, okay nobody stays."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.'"
Joey:,"b' (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?'"
Chandler:,b' (to Joey) Well he\x92s probably mad after you called him this\nmorning to borrow his goggles.'
Joey:,b' What? Mine aren\x92t tinted.'

Chandler:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' What does the sign say?'

Chandler:,b' (to Joey) My lighter\x92s in there! (points to the cab)'
Chandler:,b' Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe\x92s not hot enough to light this!'
Joey:,"b' Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put\nit on this morning.'"

Rachel:,b' What?!'
Joey:,b' Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?'
Joey:,"b' Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the\nbiggest wire.'"
Joey:,"b' If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, Monica\x92s are the biggest.'"
Rachel:,"b' What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually\nsometimes, st-stuff my bra.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, I stuff outside the bra.'"
Chandler:,"b' Ladies, ladies, let\x92s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take\noff Monica\x92s bra.'"
Phoebe:,"b' All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.'"
Rachel:,"b' (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right\nthere.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and\nsave us.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.'"
Joey:,"b' Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, now let\x92s decide who has the nicest ass.'"
Joey:,b' (opening the door) And there you go!'
Chandler:,b' At least let me smoke it to the good part.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!'"
Rachel:,"b' What, what\x92s it, what\x92s going on?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, this has happened before.'"
Rachel:,b' So you know how to fix it?'

Ross:,"b' Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?'"
Ross:,b' Ah! (realises) Oh.'
Ross:,"b"" Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. \x91Cause you\nknow love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so\nRachel and I broke up."""
Ross:,"b' Yeah, well.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah, I\x92d love that.'"
Ross:,b' I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the\ntable.)'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.'"
Rachel:,b' Great!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, what town are we near?'"
Phoebe:,b' (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route\nwe\x92re on?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)\nThere is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?'"
Rachel:,"b' I don\x92t know, I\x92m sorry, I always slept in the back when we\ndrove up here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check\nevery rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don\x92t do\nthat.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.'"
Rachel:,"b' No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live\nhere! '"
Phoebe:,b' But if...'
Rachel:,"b' No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you\x92ll have to\nthink of something else.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.'"
Chandler:,b' I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another\ncigarette.)'
Chandler:,b' Well it\x92s very unsettling.'
Ross:,"b"" ....right? Right? I mean it\x92s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they\njust took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don\x92t, I don\x92t need\nthem, huh, I\x92ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."""
Ross:,"b' (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where\x92s 717? (He gets up to\nreturn the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross\ngrabs the last piece.) Hey, you\x92ve have more of these for Susan right?'"
Phoebe:,"b' (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.'"
Ross:,"b' Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?'"
Phoebe:,b' I ate a bug.'
Phoebe:,"b' Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don\x92t know where we are, so\nwe can\x92t get a tow truck.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, now you want a favour?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yes, please.'"
Ross:,"b' Well, oh, I\x92m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I\x92m a little\ntoo busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got\nhome safely okay?'"
Ross:,"b' No, I\x92m not gonna pick them up.'"
Ross:,"b' No, Rachel doesn\x92t want me to....'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, you\x92re right.'"
Ross:,"b' We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms\ndown) yeah. Where are you? I\x92ll find you. (hangs up)'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, you-you\x92re-you\x92re one to talk.'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, done.'"
Joey:,b' That\x92s \x91help\x92 spelled backwards so that the helicopters can\nread it from the air!'
Rachel:,"b' (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it\x92s Ross) Ugh!!!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s Ross on one of his drives!'"

Rachel:,b' You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.'
Ross:,b' Excuse me?'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s horrible.'
Ross:,"b' (sarcastic) Oh please, can\x92t I come to your special, magical cabin?'"
Rachel:,b' Why would you even want to come Ross? You\x92re a horrible skier.'
Ross:,"b' Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.'"
Joey:,"b' I-I can\x92t handle this, you guys.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what, I can handle it, handle\x92s my middle name. Actually\nit\x92s the ah, middle part of my first name."""

Rachel:,"b' No, I think it\x92s very obvious who\x92s wrong here.'"
Ross:,b' Obviously not to Joey.'
Joey:,b' (pause) What?'
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do.\nNo-no-no-no.'"
Chandler:,"b' Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to\nstop the fighting.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues\nto dance.) Look what you\x92re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and\nRachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay?
