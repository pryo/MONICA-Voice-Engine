Joey:,b' Hey! You guys! You\x92re not gonna believe this! I just got off the\nphone with my agent\x85'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I\x92m sorry, too soon. You go.'"
Joey:,b' Okay. I got nominated for my part on '
Phoebe:,b' Good for you!'
Joey:,b' No-no.'
Joey:,b' No! I\x92m up for a Soapie!'
Joey:,"b' No, no, no! It\x92s real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns\nfrom the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! I\x92m up for a Soapie!'"
Rachel:,b' (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious\nsoap opera award there is!'
Joey:,"b' Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I\x92m taking to the awards.\n(Points to Rachel.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, stop that! Don\x92t kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be\nthere?'"
Joey:,b' Many are scheduled to appear.'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Oh my God! I can\x92t go! I\x92m gonna be too nervous!'
Rachel:,b' No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.'
Ross:,b' \x85and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the\nVelociraptor would expand it\x92s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten\nit\x92s predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis? '
Ross:,b' Just a high pitched intimidating noise.'
Ross:,"b' Well we-we don\x92t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded\nsomething like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn\x92t know what to\nmake of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that\x92s uh, that\x92s all for\ntoday. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? '"
Ross:,"b' Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I\x92m afraid\nI-I had to fail you.'"
Ross:,b' Well you need 60% to pass\x85'
Ross:,b' Seven.'
Ross:,b' No-no it\x92s not. What-what happened there Ned?'
Ross:,"b' Well I\x92m sorry but, that-that\x92s really not my problem.'"
Ross:,b' Well that brings me in the loop a little.'
Ross:,"b' Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I\x92m your teacher. I\x92m\nsorry, you\x92re-you\x92re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be\nwritten on the backs of some of these chairs.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!'
Phoebe:,b' Go for it.'
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m just saying, get his number just in case. But no: Chandler is in\nan accident and can\x92t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to\nsatisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I did, but that was really fun.'"
Joey:,"b' (pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is\x85Joey Tribbiani! (He\nthen gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a\nbottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh\x85 Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I\ndidn\x92t prepare a speech. But umm, I\x92d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my\nparents, who\x92ve always been there for me. I\x92d also like to thank my friends,\nChandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel\x85'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92m fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple\nsyrup award!'
Joey:,b' Yeah may-maybe you don\x92t tell anyone about this.'
Rachel:,"b' What? No! It\x92s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo\nbottle.'"
Joey:,b' Really?'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' What award are you practicing for?'
Rachel:,b' '
Joey:,"b' Oh, hey listen! The Soapie\x92s called today, and I also get to present\nan award.'"
Rachel:,b' Ohh that\x92s great!'
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,"b' So you\x92ll definitely get onstage, even if you don\x92t win.'"
Joey:,b' (confused) What you-you don\x92t think I\x92m gonna win?'
Rachel:,"b' Well of course I do! But y\x92know, favorite returning character is a\ntough category Joey. I mean you\x92re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it\x92s just\x85I\x92ve\nnever even been nominated before! I want it so much.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well Joey, you\x92ll probably get it. But you should probably\nstart practicing your gracious loser face. Y\x92know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna\nlook disappointed, but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y\x92know? So it\x92s\nsorta like\x85 (Does it, you\x92ll have to see it.)'"
Joey:,b' Hey! (Likes it.)'
Rachel:,b' Y\x92know?'
Joey:,b' You practice losing the '
Rachel:,"b' Oh no, at the '"
Joey:,b' Ah.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, great! We couldn\x92t keep our eyes off each other all night and\nthen every once and a while y\x92know, he\x92d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and\ntouch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' (laughs) All I could think of was y\x92know, ""Is he gonna kiss\nme? Is he gonna kiss me?""'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m a lady Monica, I don\x92t kiss and tell. But this hickey\nspeaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)'"
Phoebe:,b' I just like him so much that I just feel like I\x92ve had 10 drinks\ntoday and I\x92ve only had six.'
Phoebe:,b' You sound like a guy.'
Phoebe:,b' You\x92ll have a last kiss.'
Ross:,b' Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?'
Joey:,b' Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?'
Ross:,b' There\x92s this kid in my class who said he\x92s in love with me.'
Joey:,b' Whoa!'
Rachel:,b' (entering from her room) Whoa what?'
Joey:,b' Ross has a boyfriend.'
Ross:,b' I do-I do '
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Ross:,"b' Yeah! I don\x92t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.\nWhat-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of\x85sexy professor vibe? (Rachel\nand Joey both look at him.)'"
Rachel:,b' Not right now.'
Ross:,b' It-it\x97The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and\nit was so hard! Y\x92know you\x97I couldn\x92t concentrate and I blushed every time\nhe looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what\x92s it\x92s like to be 19 and in\nlove.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' How\x92d you get over that teacher?'
Rachel:,b' I didn\x92t. I got under him.'
Joey:,b' (To Ross) Problem solved.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay bye. (They kiss.)'
Phoebe:,b' Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye\nat the door so as not to flaunt our new love.'
Phoebe:,b' (yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)'
Chandler:,b' Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.'
Joey:,b' (To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.'
Rachel:,b' I know! My God! Do you have your speech?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I got my speech!'"
Rachel:,b' Do you got your gracious loser face?'
Joey:,b' Yeah. (Does it.)'
Rachel:,"b' Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!'"
Joey:,b' Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?'
Rachel:,b' On TV?! Yeah!'
Joey:,b' \x91Kay! '
Joey:,"b' What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which\nis drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he\x92s on TV\nright now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)'"
Joey:,b' (angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for\nthis award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head\nin disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are: from '
Rachel:,b' Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!'
Joey:,"b' Rach, we had to get out of there because: look what I won! (He whips out\nthe award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God, you stole her award!'"
Joey:,"b' No-no! No, I\x92m accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the\nTV to display it.)'"
Rachel:,b' Joey I don\x92t think you know what behalf means.'
Joey:,"b' Sure I do! It\x92s a verb! As in, ""I behalfin\x92 it!""'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, you have got to take this back!'"
Joey:,"b' But why?! I should\x92ve won one and I really want it, and she\ndidn\x92t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a '"
Rachel:,b' (looking at the award) No! Joey!'
Joey:,b' Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of\n\x91em.'
Rachel:,b' Do you really want an award you didn\x92t win?'
Joey:,"b' No! I want an award I did win! But nobody\x92s giving me any of those!\nPlus\x97Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come\nover they\x92ll see it and they\x92ll think I won it.'"
Rachel:,"b' Joey, it says Best Supporting Actress!'"
Joey:,b' I can scratch that right off.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, no: this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don\x92t\nwant to win an award this way. You\x92re very talented. And someday you\x92re gonna\nwin one of these for real, and '"
Joey:,b' All right!'
Rachel:,b' All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.'
Joey:,b' I\x92ll take it back tomorrow.'
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Joey:,b' (opening his door) If I can\x92t have it you can\x92t have it! (Rachel\nwalks away angrily.)'
Ross:,"b' (turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?'"
Ross:,b' And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)'
Ross:,b' (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!'
Ross:,b' No!'
Ross:,"b' Well that\x92s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with\nme!'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' I can\x92t believe someone would do that for a grade.'
Phoebe:,b' No. Why?'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, don\x92t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere\naround so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy\x92s cute. (Points to a guy\nsitting behind Monica.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' No, that is the '"
Phoebe:,b' Because you\x92re marrying him!'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, I\x92ve never been engaged and I\x92ve never really been\nmarried, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears\nor anxieties about a relationship, do '"
Phoebe:,"b' That is correct! Yes, you\x92re supposed to take all of that stuff and\nput it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! You\x92re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell\nChandler! Hurry before it\x92s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean\nputting out doesn\x92t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)'
Rachel:,b' I cannot believe I\x92m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!'
Joey:,b' Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, I\x92m totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)'"
Joey:,b' Hey Jessica.'
Rachel:,b' (coolly) Hey Jess.'
Joey:,"b' Ah, this is my friend Rachel.'"
Rachel:,b' \x91Sup? (Joey glares at her.)'
Joey:,"b' Uh listen, here\x92s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to\nher.)'"
Joey:,"b' Well, that-that-that\x92s it? You\x92re gonna, you\x92re gonna put\nit on your shelf or anything?'"
Joey:,b' (To Rachel) Take it back?'
Rachel:,b' Absolutely.'
Joey:,"b' Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with\nflowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big'"
Chandler:,b' Kinda. They\x92re really big.'
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' No. No, see when I first meet somebody it\x92s uh it\x92s mostly\npanic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.'"
Chandler:,"b' Sleeping with somebody new: anxiety, panic, and, I\x92m afraid, even\nmore sweating.'"
Chandler:,"b' I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our\nrelationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be\ntogether for the rest of our lives.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well yeah! But now that I know that you\x92re having these thoughts,\nI\x92m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I\x92m definitely gonna need some kind of sports\ndrink.'"
Chandler:,b' (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!'
Ross:,"b' Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?'"
Ross:,"b' Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to\nknow that I\x92m changing your grade back.'"
Ross:,b' \x91Cause I know what you\x92re trying to pull here. Okay? It\x92s\nnot gonna work.'
Ross:,b' Y\x92know what? I-I\x92m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This\nlittle thing is over. I '
Phoebe:,b' Rach? '
Rachel:,b' I\x92ll be out in a second.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh. (Picks it up.) It\x92s just so unexpected! I\x85I uh\x85Boy\nI\x92ll tell you it\x92s just such an honor to be nominated for a'
Rachel:,"b' (entering from her room) Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at\n8:00.'"
Phoebe:,b' \x85in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. (To an imaginary Neil\nSimon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.)'
Rachel:,"b' Okay honey, you can finish this later we\x92re gonna be late. We gotta\ngo.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Please, don\x92t play the music. Just uh one more. '"
