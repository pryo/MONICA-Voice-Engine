Chandler:,"b"" Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how\nyou got there. (The phone rings and Chandler doesn't answer it.)"""
Ross:,"b"" You ever figure out what that thing's for?"""
Chandler:,"b"" No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if\nI'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never\ngets pinned. """
Chandler:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' (answering the phone, in a deep voice) Bob here.'"

Chandler:,"b"" Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh,\nCentral Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"""
Chandler:,b' Ok. (He hangs up.) Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.'
Ross:,"b' Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I\'m thinkin\' when she sees\nyou tomorow, she\'s probably gonna realize, ""Hey, you\'re not Bob.""'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the\nopen arms of the wry stranger at the next table."""
Ross:,b' Oh my god. You are pure evil.'
Chandler:,"b"" Ok, pure evil (holds up his left hand), horny and alone (holds up his\nright hand). I've done this (He shakes his right hand.)"""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New\nMexico."""

Phoebe:,"b"" Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? Y'know, like from,\nlike 20?"""
Chandler:,"b' Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.'"
Joey:,b' Do we need a cake?'
Chandler:,"b"" Look guys, I know it's a little steep."""
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, whoosh! (Imitates going over a cliff with her hand.)'"
Chandler:,"b"" But it's Ross."""
Phoebe:,"b"" It's Ross."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, you're right."""
Chandler:,"b"" I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."""

Rachel:,"b' So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?'"
Joey:,"b"" Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll\njust stay home and eat dust bunnies."""
Phoebe:,b' Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?'
Rachel:,"b"" Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just\ndon't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"""
Joey:,"b' Yes! Yeah, it\'s like they\'re always saying ""let\'s go here, let\'s go\nthere"". Like we can afford to go here and there.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, y'know, someplace nice,\ny'know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday\nthing, it's for Ross."""
Joey:,b' For Ross.'
Rachel:,"b' For Ross, Ross, Ross.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Joey:,b' Hi.'

Ross:,"b"" I'm tellin' you. You can't do this."""
Chandler:,"b' Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional\nmethods.'"
Ross:,"b"" That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is\nwho she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness."""
Chandler:,"b"" We don't know Bob!\xa0 Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me\nbe happy."""
Ross:,b' Go over there and tell that woman the truth.'
Chandler:,"b' All right. (He gets up, but swings around the pole back to their\ntable.)'"
Ross:,b' Go.'
Chandler:,b' Hi. '
Chandler:,"b' Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.'"
Chandler:,b' Whoever stood you up is a jerk.'
Chandler:,"b"" I don't know. (He sits down.) I just had this weird sense. You know,\nbut that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? (Holds out one of this small packs.)"""
Chandler:,"b"" No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today."""

Rachel:,"b' Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.'"
Joey:,"b' What are these, like famous chickens?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm\nlate. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?"""
Ross:,"b' (to Chandler behind their menus) Well, pretty incredible according to the\nmessage she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for\nyou on my machine?'"
Chandler:,"b"" Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I\ncouldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's\nnumber."""
Ross:,"b' Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?'"
Ross:,b' That sounds great. Same for me.'
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it\nwithout the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"""
Rachel:,"b' Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.'"

Rachel:,"b"" That's 'cause you have it."""
Ross:,"b"" That's a good point."""
Chandler:,"b"" So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"""

Rachel:,"b' Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this\nbig. (Holds her thumb and forefinger a short distance apart.)'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Actually, it makes us feel that big. (She squeezes Rachel's thumb and\nforefinger closer together.)"""
Ross:,"b"" I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you\nguys."""
Chandler:,"b"" If you guys feel this big (imitates Rachel's gesture), maybe that's\nnot our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel."""
