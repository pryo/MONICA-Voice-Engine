Chandler:,"b' Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?'"

Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no, I can\x92t do that.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'

Phoebe:,"b' Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don\x92t hire\nan assistant because they\x92re cute, you hire them because they\x92re qualified.'"
Rachel:,"b' Uh-huh. No, I hear what you\x92re saying and-and-and that makes a lot\nof sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!'"

Ross:,"b' Well, Chandler and I are in a bar\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""'"
Ross:,"b' And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes\nover to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what\nyou\x92re thinking, Chandler\x92s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes\nout with girls, and you\x92re right, Chandler\x92s not the type of guy who just goes\nto bars and makes out with\x85girls.'"

Rachel:,"b' All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I\x92m telling\nyou\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.'
Rachel:,"b' Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably\nnot the smartest thing that I\x92ve ever done. But I\x92m telling you, from this\nmoment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There\x92s a knock on the door.) Yes? '"

Chandler:,b' Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)'
Chandler:,b' Y\x92know when I said that because we\x92re getting married that\nwe should share everything and not have any secrets? '
Chandler:,b' Yeah that was stupid. Let\x92s not do that.'
Ross:,"b' And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from\neverybody else.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, (gets up) if you\x92ll excuse me, I-I\x92m gonna go hang out\nwith some people who don\x92t know the '"
