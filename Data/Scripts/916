Chandler,b': Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?'
Chandler,"b"": I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron."""
Chandler,b': Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.'
Chandler,"b"": You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big \n  a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe \n  next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's \n  refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda \n  and beer?"""
Chandler,"b"": No! We're not borrowing money."""
Chandler,"b"": Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one \n  thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the \n  pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money."""
Chandler,"b"": That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get \n  us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard."""
Phoebe,b': Why??'
Phoebe,"b"": Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you."""
Phoebe,b': I want you to stay.'
Phoebe,"b"": Why don't you turn them inside ou..."""
Phoebe,"b"": I'll miss you."""
Phoebe,"b"": Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top."""
Phoebe,"b': Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell \n  yeah!""'"
Phoebe,"b"": Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike \n  kisses Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!"""
Phoebe,"b': I\'ve always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" \n  ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We\'re not having sex anymore!"" \n  It\'s gonna be fun!'"
Joey,b': Hey!'
Joey,"b"": I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler \n  is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong."""
Joey,"b"": Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money \n  is always a mistake."""
Joey,b': And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.'
Joey,b': Oh...how much?'
Joey,b': Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?'
Joey,"b"": That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel \n  enters)"""
Rachel,b': Hi you guys!'
Joey & Monica,b': Hey!'
Joey,"b"": Oo...what's in the bag?"""
Rachel,"b': Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that \n  this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff \n  to baby-proof the apartment.'"
Joey,"b': Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y\'know, \n  when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" \n  or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!'"
Rachel,b': No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic \n  laugh.)'
Joey,"b"": You're gonna do it?"""
Rachel,"b"": Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?"""
Joey,"b"": Oh, women can. You can't."""
Rachel,b': Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?'
Rachel,b': Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!'
Joey,b': The hardware store is right down the street.'
Rachel,b': There is a hardware store right down the street?'
Phoebe,"b"": Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news."""
Phoebe,"b"": I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy \n  before."""
Chandler,"b"": Yeah.... she's not so cute."""
Phoebe,"b': Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.'"
Phoebe,"b"": Uh huh...we're playing you two."""
Chandler,b': Yes dear.'
Ross,"b"": I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's \n  great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys.."""
Phoebe,"b"": Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. \n  You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! \n  Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress \n  that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that \n  house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can \n  send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do."""
Ross,"b': Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.'"
Phoebe,b': I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to \n  be a soccer mom!'
Phoebe,b': Yeah! You bet roomy!'
Phoebe,"b"": Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they \n  have us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs \n  nervously. They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)"""
Phoebe,b': China patterns!!!!!'
Rachel,"b"": This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater \n  sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)"""
Chandler,b': Hey Joe!'
Joey,b': Hey!'
Chandler,"b"": Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica \n  anything about it."""
Joey,"b"": I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica."""
Chandler,b': And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) \n  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.'
Joey,"b': Yeah, I know.'"
Chandler,b': What? What do you mean you know?'
Joey,"b"": Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working \n  and the economy is bad."""
Chandler,b': Oh! Right.'
Joey,"b"": (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!"""
Chandler,"b': Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.'"
Joey,b': Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?'
Chandler,b': Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey \n  begins writing a cheque)'
Joey,b': Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much \n  your rent is. (shrugs)'
Chandler,b': Oh ok.'
Joey,b': (To himself) I am on '
Chandler,b' (Stands up and walks to Joey): Listen...this is really nice. \n  Do you... (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand \n  dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?'
Joey,b': Err... Kind of.'
Chandler,"b"": I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money \n  problems?"""
Joey,"b"": Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money \n  problems, it was for something for her."""
Chandler,b': What?'
Joey,b': Something personal.'
Chandler,"b"": What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that \n  she wouldn't tell me about?"""
Joey,b': Boob job.'
Joey,"b"": Well it's...It's not """
Phoebe,"b"": Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase \n  it's a play on the word roomy."""
Phoebe,"b"": Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See \n  where it goes."""
Phoebe,b': What do you mean?'
Phoebe,b': Oh. Wow.'
Phoebe,b': Was it really that bad?'
Phoebe,"b"": Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different \n  with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once \n  in the ocean."""
Phoebe,"b"": But it's just..."""
Phoebe,b': Oh!'
Phoebe,"b"": No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to \n  make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you \n  start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!"""
Phoebe,b': Yeah I get that.'
Rachel,b': Hi!'
Rachel,"b"": Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks."""
Rachel,"b"": Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh \n  wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)"""
Chandler,b': Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.'
Rachel,"b"": Don't look at me I never get his jokes."""
Chandler,"b"": Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one \n  thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not..."""
Chandler,"b': No no! I just love the way you look,\xc2\xa0 I am warm, for \n  your form.'"
Chandler,b': Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks \n  nice. I want to compliment your '
Chandler,"b"": I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger \n  would you? Don't answer that."""
Rachel,"b"": Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder."""
Rachel,"b"": I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?"""
Rachel,"b"": No you really think that's what it is?"""
Rachel,"b"": Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. \n  Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna \n  lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!"""
Phoebe,b': Hi'
Ross,b': Hey!'

Ross,"b"": Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can \n  see for all hanging out but to come to my home!"""
Phoebe,b': No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.'
Ross,b': Why?'
Phoebe,"b"": Mike doesn't ever wanna get married."""
Ross,b': Never?'
Phoebe,b': Never.'
Ross,"b': wow, are you still going to move in with him?'"
Phoebe,"b"": I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't \n  really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. \n  That marriage stinks!"""
Ross,"b': Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight \n  and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.'"
Phoebe,"b"": That's not how you really feel is it?"""
Ross,"b"": No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right \n  now but I can't help it. I love marriage."""
Phoebe,b': Seriously? You divorce-o?'
Ross,"b': If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"". \n  It\'s just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn\'t exactly work out. But I love \n  to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before \n  she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I\'m sorry.'"
Phoebe,"b"": It's ok that's how you feel."""
Ross,b': But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you \n  guys have so much fun and you love Mike.'

Phoebe,"b"": It's not cooler."""
Ross,b': Yeah I just hurt it.'

Chandler,"b': Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able \n  to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?'"
Rachel,"b"": Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going \n  to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little \n  present that's shooting out of her!?"""
Chandler,b': (sedated) What?'
Rachel,b': Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob \n  job?'

Phoebe,"b': Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.'"
Ross,"b"": Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised \n  I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."""
Phoebe,b': What do you mean?'
Ross,"b': Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught \n  up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly \n  picture yourself in a Volvo?'"
Phoebe,b': They are awfully boxy...'
Ross,"b"": I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... \n  normal."""
Phoebe,b': Uh huh.'
Ross,"b': Hey hey, can I help?'"
Chandler,"b': Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored \n  a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where \n  it gets '"
Ross,b': You know sometimes your words... they hurt.'
Joey,"b': Hey uh, where do you guys want this?'"

Joey,"b"": (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck \n  huh?"""
Phoebe,b': Someday.'
Chandler,b': Aaaaand....... hernia.'
Phoebe,"b"": I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt \n  I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of \n  the regular stuff."""
Phoebe,"b"": Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love \n  you, and I wanted to live with you."""
Phoebe,"b"": But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't \n  know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever \n  gonna happen."""
Phoebe,b': Are you gonna change yours?'
Phoebe,b': Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what \n  I want.'
Phoebe,"b"": I don't want it to end either."""
Phoebe,b': Yeah.'
Chandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica,b': Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye \n  now!'
