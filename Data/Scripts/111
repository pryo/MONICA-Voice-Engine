Phoebe:,b' We should do something. Whistle.'
Phoebe:,"b' Come on, do it.'"
Phoebe:,b' Do it!'
Phoebe:,b' Do it do it do it!'
Phoebe:,"b"" I can't believe you did that!"""
Phoebe:,"b' I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to\nhim) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Maybe nobody's tried this."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's\nartistic."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening,\ny'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."""
Phoebe:,b' I know.'
Chandler:,b' Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.'"
Joey:,"b"" I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)"""
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know, we don't have to watch this. """
Rachel:,"b' No way, forget it.'"
Joey:,"b"" C'mon, she's your mom!"""
Chandler:,b' Exactly. '
Rachel:,"b"" Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I\ncannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old\nand all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"""
Ross:,"b"" C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."""
Chandler:,"b"" You can say that because she's not your mom."""
Ross:,"b' Oh, please...'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)'"
Ross:,b' When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?'
Ross:,"b"" Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a\ndream I had- but, phew."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Hey hey hey! She's on!"""
Phoebe:,b' Your mom was arrested?'
Chandler:,"b' Shhh, busy beaming with pride.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Now why would she say that's embarrassing?"""
Chandler:,"b"" THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!"""
Chandler:,b' This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.'
Chandler:,b' ...And then he burst into flames.'
Phoebe:,b' What about Glen? He could be a Glen. '
Phoebe:,b' Ooh! How about Agamemnon?'
Chandler:,"b"" Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken."""
Chandler:,"b' Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.'"
Ross:,"b"" (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place."""
Chandler:,b' I know I am.'
Phoebe:,"b"" I'm in."""
Ross:,"b"" Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."""
Rachel:,"b"" Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of\ntime."""
Ross:,b' ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)'
Ross:,b' Anyone want me to appraise anything?'
Rachel:,"b"" Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.\nNo, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a\nwriter."""
Chandler:,"b' Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and\nhe tries to pretend he was in the other one)"""
Ross:,b' Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.'
Ross:,"b"" No. It's the one he's licking."""
Ross:,"b"" You're good."""
Ross:,b' The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?'
Ross:,b' When?'
Ross:,b' The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?'
Ross:,b' Please.'
Ross:,b' Right.'
Ross:,b' Uh-oh...'
Joey:,"b"" Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street."""
Ross:,"b' Hey, is Chandler here?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Ross:,"b"" Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes\nhis head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a\nkiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"""
Joey:,b' Right. No big deal.'
Ross:,b' Okay. '
Joey:,b' In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!'
Ross:,b' What code?'
Joey:,"b"" You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'\naunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"""
Chandler:,b' What are you guys doing out here?'
Ross:,"b' Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning\nracquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."""
Ross:,"b"" No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to\nbring me one."""
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."""
Chandler:,"b' Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside\nand shuts the door)'"
Ross:,"b"" Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."""
Joey:,"b' Ross, how could you let this happen?'"
Ross:,"b"" I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?\nShe's, she's sexy, she's..."""
Joey:,"b"" You don't think my mom's sexy?"""
Ross:,b' Well... not in the same way...'
Joey:,"b"" I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,\nalright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"""
Ross:,"b"" Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."""
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b"" What're you guys doing out here?"""
Ross:,"b' Well, not playing raquetball!'"
Joey:,b' He forgot to leave his grip size!'
Ross:,"b"" He didn't get the goggles!"""
Rachel:,"b' Well,sounds like you two have issues.'"
Rachel:,"b' Goodbye, baby.'"
Ross:,b' Do they wait for me to do this?'
Joey:,b' So are you gonna tell him?'
Ross:,b' Why would I tell him?'
Joey:,"b"" How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."""
Ross:,b' Oh...'
Joey:,"b"" Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!"""
Phoebe:,b' Hi.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I..\ny'know, so what are you doing here?"""

Phoebe:,"b' Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to\nreveal him wearing new pajamas.)'"
Chandler:,b' Oh my God. '
Ross:,"b"" You're my friend. I-I had to tell you."""
Chandler:,"b"" I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?"""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you\nknow how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I\ncan't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."""
Chandler:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b"" I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much\ntequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing\nhappened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"""
Chandler:,b' (To Joey) You knew about this?'
Joey:,"b"" Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."""
Chandler:,"b"" I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"""
Joey:,"b"" Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows\nwhat woulda happened."""
Ross:,"b' Thanks, man, big help.'"
Chandler:,"b"" (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?"""

Ross:,b' I know-'
Chandler:,"b"" I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)"""
Ross:,b' Chandler-'
Joey:,"b"" Me neither, y'know what-"""
Chandler:,"b"" I'm still mad at you for not telling me."""
Joey:,b' What are you mad at me for?!'
Ross:,b' Chandler-'
Chandler:,b' You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)'
Joey:,"b"" (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See\nwhat happens when you break the code?"""
Ross:,b' Joey-'
Joey:,b' Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,\ndo you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"""
Phoebe:,b' (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.'
Rachel:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,b' Hello.'
Phoebe:,b' Going to the hospital tonight?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, you?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can\nwe do this now?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!'
Joey:,"b"" (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on\ntheir wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."""
Ross:,"b"" I cannot believe we're having this conversation."""
Joey:,"b"" C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."""
Rachel:,b' (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man\nthat I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look)\n'Kay. (Sung:) """

Chandler:,b' What was that?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?\n(Goes to the counter)'"
Joey:,"b"" (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up."""
Ross:,"b"" Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I\njust wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."""
Chandler:,"b"" Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian\nnightmare. """
Ross:,"b"" Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"""
Ross:,"b"" (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play."""
Chandler:,"b"" That's very funny. We done now?"""
Ross:,"b"" No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell\nher how you feel?"""
Chandler:,"b"" That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my\nmom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."""
Ross:,"b"" Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his\nfinger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)\nThat's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!"""
Phoebe:,"b' Alright, whadyou do with him?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Look at you! How, how do you feel?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I'm Phoebe Buffay."""

Phoebe:,b' You know who shaved you? That was me.'
Phoebe:,b' I sang. (To Monica) Hah!'
Phoebe:,"b"" You're welcome."""
Phoebe:,"b"" What, that's it? """
Phoebe:,"b"" I don't think you mean that."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the\ncoma."""
Chandler:,"b"" No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."""
Chandler:,b' You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.'
Chandler:,b' Really stupid.'
Chandler:,b' Yeah. No. No...'
Ross:,"b' Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.'"
Joey:,"b' Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about\neverything.'"
Ross:,"b"" You're kidding."""
Joey:,"b' No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a\nmom?""'"
Ross:,b' Wow!'
Joey:,"b' Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up\nand realise I have a bomb?""'"
Ross:,"b' \'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn\'t say ""When are you gonna\ngrow up and realise I am your mom?""'"
Joey:,b' That makes more sense.'
Ross:,"b"" So, what's going on now?"""
Joey:,"b"" I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to\nthe door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)"""
Ross:,b' Whaddya see?'

Chandler:,"b' Yeah, okay.'"
Chandler:,b' Nice save.'
Ross:,b' (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Ross:,b' You mean that?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah? How'd it go?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. """
Ross:,"b' Well, howdya feel?'"
Chandler:,b' Pretty good! I told her.'
Ross:,"b"" Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your\nmom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go\ndown that road."""
Rachel:,"b"" Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute\nhonest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."""
Joey:,"b"" You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'."""
Rachel:,"b"" Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."""
Ross:,"b"" Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,\nyou don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"""
