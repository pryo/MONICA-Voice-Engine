Joey:,"b' (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?'"
Chandler:,"b"" (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe \n  I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV."""
Joey:,"b' Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.'"
Chandler:,b' I could fall asleep at a play.'
Phoebe:,b' What is it?'
Joey:,"b' It\'s a one-woman play called ""Why don\'t you like me: a bitter \n  woman\'s journey through life"".'"
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman \n  complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, \n  faking to fall asleep)"""
Phoebe:,"b' I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what \n  more do these broads want?'"
Joey:,"b' You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!'"
Ross:,"b"" What? How come that you don't have to go!"""
Joey:,b' I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work'
Chandler:,"b"" (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?"""
Rachel:,"b' (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks \n  her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.'"
Joey:,"b' (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) \n  Hey, here you go.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) \n  oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?'"
Rachel:,"b"" Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... \n  and not have it be a big deal?"""
Rachel:,b' No reason.'
Rachel:,b' Yeah'
Rachel:,"b' (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!'"
Rachel:,b' (giggling and whispering) Maybe.'
Rachel:,"b' (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that \n  starts with ""because"") Seriously I did not understand a word that \n  you said.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't \n  get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"""
Rachel:,"b' Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.'"
Rachel:,b' I know them from work.'
Rachel:,"b' No, one of them...'"
Rachel:,"b"" I don't know, what were the names I just said?"""
Rachel:,b' '
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,"b"" Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today."""
Chandler:,"b' Yes, but, Ross you'"
Ross:,"b"" (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's \n  not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department \n  and I have to meet them here and show them around campus."""
Ross:,"b"" It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing \n  tweed jackets with suede elbow patches."""
Ross:,"b"" (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede."""
Ross:,"b"" Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."""
Ross:,"b"" Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd \n  just, you know, be at the gym working out."""
Chandler:,"b"" (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."""
Ross:,"b' Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.'"
Ross:,"b' (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably \n  get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.'"
Ross:,"b"" I don't think so."""
Ross:,"b' Oh, well he\'s obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if \n  you can\'t come on time, then don\'t come at all"". (pause) An option that \n  many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?'"
Ross:,"b"" You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?"""
Ross:,"b' Oh, damn it!'"
Joey:,b' (entering the room) Hey!'
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,"b"" What's happenin'?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman \n  show tonight."""
Joey:,"b"" Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and \n  so, you know me, work comes first"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)'"
Joey:,b' (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!'
Rachel:,b' (angry) You are having a party tonight??'
Joey:,"b"" Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people."""
Rachel:,"b"" And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were \n  gonna get away with that?"""
Joey:,b' I do it every year.'
Rachel:,b' You do that every year??'
Joey:,"b"" I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid \n  of us??"""
Joey:,b' Yeah...'
Rachel:,b' And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times \n  restaurant?'
Joey:,b' Yeah...'
Rachel:,"b' OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime \n  tour of that button factory?'"
Joey:,"b"" (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"""
Joey:,"b"" You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous \n  people!"""
Rachel:,"b' Well, then so you just invite me...!'"
Joey:,"b"" (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst \n  one!"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, \n  I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...'"
Joey:,"b"" Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's \n  up on the roof at 8."""
Rachel:,"b"" (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! \n  I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how \n  she's behaving) And it's out of my system!"""
Ross:,"b' (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) \n  So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?'"
Ross:,"b"" (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!"""
Ross:,b' So basically all nuts?'
Ross:,"b"" I've lost the will to live."""
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,"b' Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, \n  ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, \n  or stroll...'"
Ross:,"b' (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, \n  this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.'"
Phoebe:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what \n  do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Ah, ah.'"
Ross:,"b"" (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?"""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized \n  the title to freak you out!'"
Ross:,"b"" Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and \n  she's just cool, and funny..."""
Rachel:,"b"" (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, \n  you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the \n  play."""
Ross:,"b"" Really? Wh-what's wrong?"""
Rachel:,"b"" I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... \n  I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and \n  I think I might have it!!"""
Rachel:,"b' ... Ok, who is this?'"
Ross:,"b"" I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want \n  to get my chicken disease!"""
Rachel:,b' Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...'
Rachel:,"b' What? Yes, I am!'"
Rachel:,"b"" When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel \n  better! (she closes her robe)"""
Rachel:,"b' Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!'"
Rachel:,b' Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party \n  up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!'
Ross:,"b"" (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?"""
Rachel:,"b"" And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over \n  here to tell you!!"""
Rachel:,b' Ok professor or detective?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you \n  to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that"""
Phoebe:,b' And that horrible museum tour!'
Ross:,"b' No, I arranged that...'"
Joey:,"b"" (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun."""
Phoebe:,b' We know about your party Joey.'
Joey:,b' What party?'
Joey:,b' (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...'
Joey:,b' (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! \n  (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)'
Joey:,"b"" (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it \n  (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming."""
Joey:,"b"" Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... \n  go, go get yourself a drink or something..."""
Phoebe:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,"b' Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where'"
Chandler:,b' Where the hell'
Rachel:,"b' Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.'"
Rachel:,b' Nice to meet you.'
Rachel:,b' Ok'
Rachel:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly \n  you've forgotten about Chandler!"""
Ross:,"b"" (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to \n  leave Boston, huh?"""
Ross:,"b"" Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? \n  Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?"""
Ross:,b' You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?'
Ross:,"b"" ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like \n  calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby..."""
Ross:,"b' Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the \n  accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!'"
Ross:,"b' (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, \n  but smiling) Oh I\'m sorry, I don\'t mean to pry... it\'s just that this must be \n  what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood"".'"
Ross:,b' Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?'
Ross:,"b"" (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin \n  Hobart"""
Ross:,b' Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who'
Ross:,"b' Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?'"
Ross:,b' Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full \n  glasses and goes to the counter)'
Phoebe:,b' Hey Ross!'
Ross:,"b"" (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to \n  blow my... eh. average-sized brains out."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, What's the matter?"""
Ross:,"b' She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my \n  God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and \n  pretented to be a woolly mammoth.'"
Rachel:,b' I always loved that!!'
Ross:,b' Of course'
Phoebe:,b' Worse?'
Ross:,"b' Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one \n  of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression \n  voice?) ""Can we walk""? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like \n  that?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws \n  in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)"""
Ross:,b' What? (turns around to look at Rachel)'
Rachel:,b' Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)'
Chandler:,"b' (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!'"
Chandler:,"b"" I... I don't know... you seem lovely."""
Joey:,"b' Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this \n  is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)'"
Ross:,b' Nice to meet you.'
Ross:,"b"" Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."""
Joey:,"b"" It's a science."""
Joey:,"b' Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you \n  brought and if you guys were together, or...'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really \n  smart guys.'"
Ross:,"b"" I'd lead with that."""
Joey:,b' Monica!'
Joey:,b' (To Rachel) What have you got there?'
Ross:,b' Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.'
Joey:,"b"" Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's \n  a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?"""
Rachel:,b' (drunken voice) I think I am.'
Joey:,"b"" (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. \n  This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). \n  And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three \n  and I don't feel any different."""
Joey:,"b' (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, \n  oh, pass, double-pass, pass...'"
Rachel:,"b"" (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with"""
Joey:,"b"" Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good \n  enough for you, and you deserve the best."""
Rachel:,"b"" Joey, you're so sweet."""
Joey:,"b"" That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already \n  know who you're gonna go home with tonight."""
Rachel:,b' Who (looks around)?'
Joey:,b' Me.'
Rachel:,b' (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?'
Joey:,"b"" Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)"""
Joey:,b' Gotcha.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Very funny... Joey.'"
Chandler:,"b' (to Monica) So, how did'"
Chandler:,b' Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours \n  in the history of the theater.'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because \n  as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone)"""
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through \n  as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!'"
Chandler:,b' Did somebody sign your bra?'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you \n  really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, \n  come on, a piece of paper?'"
Ross:,"b"" It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also \n  broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average \n  Joe Phd."""
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, \n  I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were \n  widely discredited."""
Phoebe:,"b"" You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, \n  and funny..."""
Ross:,b' And sexy.'
Phoebe:,b' Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!'
Ross:,"b"" Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."""
Phoebe:,"b' Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium \n  in the Devonian era was top notch!'"
Ross:,b' Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!'
Rachel:,b' (to Monica) Hey!'
Rachel:,"b"" I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna \n  do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."""
Rachel:,"b' Please, what about you and Chandler?'"
Rachel:,b' Well hello (points to herself)!'
Rachel:,"b"" I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"""
Rachel:,"b"" (pause) I'm gonna do it."""
Rachel:,b' No.'
Ross:,"b' (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?'"
Ross:,"b"" I'm smarter than"""
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.'"
