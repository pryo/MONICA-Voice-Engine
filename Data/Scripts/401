Joey:,"b' (lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode)\nOkay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom\nand dad, and I don\x92t really know what happened with that.'"
Phoebe Sr.:,b' (to Phoebe) I\x92m your mother.'
Phoebe:,b' Ehh?'
Joey:,"b' (voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn\x92t go out with\na guy like Chandler...'"
Chandler:,b' (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away\nin disgust)'
Joey:,"b' (voice-over) ...and he couldn\x92t let it go, and... I don\x92t really\nknow what happened with that either. '"
Joey:,"b' (voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross\x92s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up\nand Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has\nto choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don\x92t know what happened there\neither... '"
Joey:,"b"" Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)"""
Ross:,b' (surprised) Hi!'
Rachel and Bonnie:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,b' Awww.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you\x92re welcome a million.'"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)'"
Rachel:,b' (softly) Oh my God.'
Ross:,b' I know.'
Ross:,"b' (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.'"
Rachel:,b' Whoa! What?! Why?!'
Ross:,"b' Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.'"
Rachel:,b' Here?! Now?!'
Ross:,"b' Well, yeah. I can\x92t-I can\x92t stay here all night, and if I go in\nthere she\x92s-she\x92s gonna wanna... do stuff.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, can\x92t you tell her that you are not in the mood?'"
Ross:,"b' No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn\x92t work either, I\ncan\x92t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...'"
Rachel:,b' (interrupting) Whoa-ho.'
Ross:,"b' Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn\x92t every morning.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, making it worse!'"
Ross:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe Sr.:,b' So I guess you\x92d like to know how it all happened. '
Phoebe:,"b"" I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,\nand everyone started lying their asses off!"""
Phoebe Sr.:,"b' Noo! No! It wasn\x92t like that I... Remember how I told you how\nLily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.'"
Phoebe:,b' How close?'
Phoebe Sr.:,"b' Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.'"
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t even know how that would work!'
Phoebe Sr.:,"b' Well, we were...'"
Phoebe:,b' (interrupting) I\x92m not asking!'
Phoebe Sr.:,"b' Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was\nstupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it\x92s like to\nbe eighteen years old?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. Let\x92s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,\nand I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.'"
Phoebe Sr.:,"b' Well, I\x92m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best\nparents in the world, I didn\x92t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years\nago, and by then you were already grown up. I don\x92t know, you\x92re here, and I\nwould, I would really, I would like to get to know you.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, well, everybody does! I\x92m a really cool person. And y'know\nyou had 29 years to find that out, but you didn\x92t even try! Y'know what, you walked\nout on me, and I\x92m just, I\x92m gonna do the same thing to you."""
Phoebe Sr.:,b' Wait!'
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t '
Phoebe:,"b' (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where\x92s my\npurse?'"
Chandler:,"b' (jumping up) Oh, I\x92ll go out and get you some.'"
Chandler:,"b' Nope! Because I\x92m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who\x92s\nentering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, umm, my Mom\x92s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.'"
Chandler:,b' I found a dried up seashores.'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, my new Mom, who-who\x92s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go\nupstairs)'"
Joey:,"b' Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don\x92t you wanna stay here and talk\nabout it?'"
Phoebe:,"b' No. I\x92m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (turning around, insistently) Monica!'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s over.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, was it awful?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, it was loong. I didn\x92t even realise how late it was, until I\nnoticed the 5 o\x92clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop\nthemselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn\x92t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.'"
Rachel:,b' I wrote you a letter.'
Ross:,"b' Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns\naway.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (handing him the letter) It\x92s just some things I\x92ve been\nthinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us\ngetting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him\nfrom making contact.) Wow, it\x92s-it\x92s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So,\nI\x92d better get cracking on this baby.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I\x92ll be waiting for you, just come up when you\x92re done.'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x92ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.\nVery exciting.'"
Ross:,b' Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes\nreading the letter)'
Rachel:,"b' (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the\nletter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why\ndidn\x92t you come up?'"
Ross:,b' Done!'
Rachel:,b' You just finished?'
Ross:,"b' Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very\nimportant to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!'"
Rachel:,"b' So umm, does it?'"
Ross:,b' I\x92m sorry.'
Rachel:,b' Does it?'
Ross:,"b' Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole \x91Does it?\x92\npart just another glance.'"
Rachel:,"b"" What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!\nLook, y'know what, either it does or it doesn\x92t, and if you have to even """
Ross:,"b' (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don\x92t, I don\x92t, I don\x92t '"
Rachel:,b' Are you sure?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, sure! I\x92m sure.'"
Rachel:,b' I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from\nthe letter.)'
Chandler:,"b' All right, there\x92s a nuclear holocaust, I\x92m the last man on\nEarth. Would you go out with me?'"
Chandler:,b' I\x92ve got canned goods.'
Joey:,"b' (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you\nguys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check\nthis baby out, dug me a hole!'"
Chandler:,"b' Excellent hole, Joe.'"
Joey:,b' Oh no! No!! My hole!!'
Joey:,b' (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!'
Chandler:,"b' Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, and I\x92m a little tired from digging the hole.'"
Chandler:,b' We\x92ve got to do something!'
Joey:,"b' Well, there\x92s really only one thing you can do.'"
Joey:,b' You\x92re gonna have to pee on it.'
Joey:,"b' Don\x92t blame me, I saw it on '"
Chandler:,"b"" Y'know what, he\x92s right. There\x92s something like uh, ammonia\nin that, that like kills the pain."""
Joey:,b' If you want some privacy you can use my hole.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, I\x92m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel\ncuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod \x91Yes.\x92) Ohh!\nThat\x92s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod \x91No.\x92) But for you, yay!\nOhh.'"
Ross:,b' Hey!'
Rachel:,b' How was the beach?'
Ross:,b' What happened?'
Chandler:,b' Me too!!'
Joey:,b' Me too.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I\x92m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?'"
Ross:,b' It does. It really and truly does.'
Ross:,b' (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does '
Ross:,b' She wants '
Chandler:,"b' Oh my God! If you say that one more time, '"
Ross:,"b' Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says\nhere, (reading from the letter) \x93If you accept full responsibility...\x94 (to\nChandler and Joey) Full responsibility! \x93...I can begin to trust you again. Does that\nseem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!\x94'"
Joey:,b' No?'
Chandler:,"b' Look, Ross, you have what you want, you\x92re back with Rachel. If\nyou bring this up now you\x92re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.'"
Ross:,"b' (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you\x92re right. Yeah I guess\nI\x92ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.'"
Joey:,"b' Sure, it\x92s hard to forget! But that doesn\x92t mean you have to\ntalk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)\never talk about.'"
Ross:,b' What the hell happened on that beach?!'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s between us and the sea, Ross!'"
Phoebe:,"b' (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, well umm, I know that we haven\x92t talked in a long time, but\numm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.'"
Phoebe:,b' (shocked) You know her?!'
Phoebe:,"b' There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods \x91Yes.\x92) Well, do\nyou still have it?'"
Phoebe:,b' I can\x92t believe you didn\x92t tell me there was a suicide note!'
Phoebe:,"b' I, umm, shut up!'"
Phoebe:,b' (reading from the note) \x93Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I\x92ll miss\nyou. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.\x94 You just wrote this!'
Phoebe:,b' Noooo!!'
Joey:,b' Nope.'
Chandler:,b' (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!'
Phoebe:,b' No. I\x92m-I\x92m to depressed to talk.'
Chandler:,b' I\x92ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.'
Ross:,"b' (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think\nabout making that beach trip an annual thing?'"
"Chandler, Monica, and Joey:",b' NO!!!'
Rachel:,"b' All right, that\x92s it, you guys! What happened out there?'"
Ross and Rachel:,b' Come on!'
Ross:,b' What happened? Joey?'
Joey:,b' All right. (gets up) '
Chandler:,b' (running over and joining Monica) They\x92ll never understand!'
Joey:,"b' Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It\x92s eating me\nalive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.'"
Chandler:,b' (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.\nWe didn\x92t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica\x92s\nshoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)'
Joey:,b' And I was tired from digging the huge hole!'
Chandler:,b' And then Joey remembered something.'
Joey:,b' I\x92d seen this thing on '
Ross:,b' Wait a minute! I saw that! On '
Phoebe and Rachel:,b' Ewwww!!'
"Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel:",b' (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!'
Joey:,"b' That\x92s right I stepped up! She\x92s my friend and she needed help!\nAnd if I had too, I\x92d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn\x92t. I got the\nstage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to\nChandler.'"
Chandler:,"b' (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, \x93Do it\nnow! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!\x94 Sometimes late at night I can still here the\nscreaming.'"
Joey:,b' (laughs) That\x92s \x91cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to\nfreak you out.'
Phoebe:,"b' (singing) \x93...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my\nbedroommmm.\x94 (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the\ncolours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.\nYou go away.'"
Phoebe Sr.:,"b' I\x92ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there\nhasn\x92t been a day where I didn\x92t regret giving you up.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, bye.'"
Phoebe Sr.:,"b"" No, I\x92m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the\nreason I didn\x92t look you up was, well I was afraid that you\x92d react, just well\nlike, the way, the way you\x92re reacting right now, and can\x92t we just, y'know,\nstart from here?"""
Phoebe:,b' No.'
Phoebe Sr.:,"b"" Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family.\nI\x92m family, I\x92m it. Now, now I\x92m done. (starts to leave)"""
Phoebe:,"b"" But, it\x92s not like we\x92re losing anything. Y'know?"""

Phoebe Sr.:,"b' I knew it, wow!!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?'"
Phoebe Sr.:,"b' Ohh, so cute.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I\x92m-I\x92m mad at you.'"
Phoebe Sr.:,b' I know. I\x92m mad at me too.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I\x92m kinda hungry.'"
Phoebe Sr.:,b' Hey! Me too!'
Phoebe:,"b' All right, stop it. Now you\x92re just doing it to freak me out.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh-hooo, I missed you.'"
Ross:,b' I missed you too.'
Rachel:,"b"" Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to\neverything, it just showed me how much you\x92ve grown. Y'know?"""
Ross:,b' (getting miffed) I suppose.'
Rachel:,"b' You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom '"
Ross:,b' (getting angry) Umm-hmm.'
Rachel:,"b' Ooh, I just wish we hadn\x92t lost those four months, but if time was\nwhat you needed just to gain a little perspective...'"
