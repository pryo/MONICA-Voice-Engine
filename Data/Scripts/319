Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Rachel:,"b' Hi! All right, let\x92s go shoppin\x92!!'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, okay.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! Umm....'
Phoebe:,b' We were out of '
Ross:,"b' Hey, how\x92d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?'"
Chandler:,"b' Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold\nseparately.'"
Ross:,b' Still?!'
Chandler:,b' Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from '
Chandler:,b' Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?'
Joey:,"b' (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old\nbaddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table\nand exits)'"
Ross:,b' I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm\nis going to get you.'"
Joey:,"b' Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast\nmember.) Hey.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, so you\x92re playing Adrienne, huh?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I\x92m Joey Tribianni.'"
Joey:,"b' So the ah, play\x92s pretty great, huh?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, forget about it. She rocks!'"
Joey:,b' Dr. Drake Remoray. '
Joey:,"b' Hey, I\x92ve done plays before. I\x92m a serious actor.'"
Joey:,"b' See, I actually '"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, that was real.'"
Phoebe:,b' Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.'
Rachel:,b' I know.'
Phoebe:,"b' What, so what are you gonna tell him?'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, I told him I would think about it, but I\x92m gonna tell him no.'"
Phoebe:,b' Huh.'
Rachel:,"b"" I mean I think I\x92d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this\nGunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I\x92m\nstanding there with this charming, cute guy, who\x92s asking me to go out with him,\nwhich I\x92m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I\x92d be cheating on Ross\nor something."""
Phoebe:,"b' Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you\x92re not over Ross yet and\nyou have issues with your father.'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t have any issues with my Father.'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, so it\x92s probably just the Ross thing then.'"
Joey:,"b' I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about\nthat info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and\nwhenever I can\x92t do it, they\x92re all like-like laughing at me.'"
Ross:,b' (entering) Hello.'
Chandler and Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.'
Joey:,"b' Wow, what-what do you think she wants?'"
Ross:,"b' Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without\nme.... a-sucks.'"
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s possible. You are very loveable, I\x92d miss you if I\nbroke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.'"
Ross:,b' Then be supportive like a guy.'
Chandler:,"b' (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I\x92d miss you.'"
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' You ah, wanted to see me?'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah. Ahh, here\x92s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)'"
Ross:,b' What?!'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, y'know, it\x92s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD\x92s, just\nsort of stuff that you\x92ve left here."""
Ross:,b' What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?'
Rachel:,"b"" No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it\x92s time we-we y'know,\nmove on. I mean, I mean don\x92t\x92 you think?"""
Ross:,b' Yes. '
Rachel:,b' Yeah?'
Ross:,"b' Yes, I do.'"
Rachel:,b' Good.'
Ross:,"b' Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this\nwas a gift?!'"
Rachel:,"b' Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.'"
Ross:,b' It\x92s still a gift! I got it from the '
Rachel:,"b' Okay, all right, give me the mug! I\x92ll keep the mug.'"
Ross:,"b"" No!! Y'know-y'know don\x92t do me any favours. In fact, where,\nwhere\x92s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this\nbook is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I\x92d like that back too.\nYes, I do."""
Rachel:,b' You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that\nT-shirt!'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m just trying to help you, move on.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....'"
Ross:,b' Petty...'
Rachel:,b' Petty... (goes into her room)'
Ross:,b' Petty...'
Rachel:,b' Petty...'
Ross:,b' Petty...'
Rachel:,b' Small...'
Ross:,b' Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking\nher.)'
Rachel:,b' You are so just doing this out of spite.'
Ross:,"b' Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!'"
Rachel:,b' Huh?'
Ross:,b' I\x92m-I\x92m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he\nkisses the shirt)'
Rachel:,b' You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn\x92t even\nfit you anymore!'
Ross:,"b' Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...'"
Rachel:,b' (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!'
Ross:,"b' Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on\nthe T-shirt. It\x92s an old \x91Frankie says relax\x92 T-shirt, that barely fits\nhim. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don\x92t mind I\x92m\ngonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a\npleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' So, you\x92re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)'"
Chandler:,b' And you\x92re our age. You\x92re our age.'
Phoebe:,"b"" Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name\nit after yourself."""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s not a state Joe.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?'"
Chandler:,b' You\x92re our age!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, kinda.'"
Joey:,"b' Well, why don\x92t you tell me what you\x92re supposed to be! Huh?\nBecause I sure as hell can\x92t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin\x92. You look\nat me, and it\x92s nothin\x92. (He kisses her) Nothing.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b"" Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it\x92s says so in the script! Y'know\nah, I-I don\x92t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script\nhere that you\x92re a bitch."""
Joey:,b' It does in mine!'
Chandler:,"b' I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn\x92t matter, I\nstill wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing\non the middle part of my head. It\x92s so annoying. Does it bug you?'"
Ross:,b' You bug me.'
Chandler:,b' Is there any chance you didn\x92t see that?'
Chandler:,b' Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can\x92t just stare through the\npeep hole for three hours! You\x92re gonna get peep eye!'
Ross:,"b"" I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she\x92d say\nno, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!"""
Chandler:,b' You didn\x92t just break up.'
Ross:,"b' Hey, it\x92s been like three weeks!'"
Chandler:,b' You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I\nmean bullets have left guns slower!'
Ross:,"b' Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,\nI\x92m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can\x92t, I can\x92t watch this. (turns away,\nthen quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,\nshe\x92s going in.'"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Ross:,"b' She\x92s going in. Wait! He\x92s going in! He\x92s going in!! The\ndoor\x92s closed! I, I can\x92t see anything but the door closed!!'"
Chandler:,b' And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!'"
Chandler:,b' Stop what?!'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will\ndo it. I\x92ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!'"
Chandler:,b' No!! You can\x92t!! '
Ross:,"b' Look, they must be stopped!'"
Chandler:,"b' I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!\n(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly\nstrong!'"
Ross:,b' I need juice! People need juice!!'
Chandler:,b' Look man!'
Ross:,b' People need juice!'
Chandler:,b' Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the\ndoor shut with his feet.) '
Ross:,"b' Juice, I need...'"
Chandler:,"b' She\x92s moving on! Okay, if it\x92s not this guy, it\x92s gonna\nbe somebody else! And unless you\x92re thinking about subletting my peep hole, '"
Ross:,"b' Yeah, okay. '"
Chandler:,b' Okay. '
Ross:,b' It\x92s just I miss her so much.'
Chandler:,b' I know. (He rubs Ross\x92s head) '
Rachel:,"b' Oh. That\x92s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is\nmissing, she can be like, \x91Where\x92s number 27?!\x92'"
Rachel:,"b"" Y'know what?"""
Rachel:,b' I can\x92t do this.'
Rachel:,"b"" Well, oh, Mark, I\x92m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?\nI\x92m just doing it to get back at Ross. I\x92m sorry, it\x92s not very fair to\nyou."""
Rachel:,b' Oh God. I\x92m sorry about this.'
Rachel:,b' You sure?'
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.\n(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a\ngunfighter in a Western.) '"
Chandler:,"b' (to Joey) I wasn\x92t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing\nhis stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?'"
Joey:,"b' Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she\x92s like the\ngreatest actress since, since, sliced bread!'"
Chandler:,"b' Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.'"
Joey:,"b' God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, \x91Oh, I\x92m so\ntalented.\x92 and \x91Oh, I\x92m so pretty,\x92 and \x91Ooh, I smell so\ngood.\x92'"
Chandler:,b' I think somebody has a crush on somebody.'
Joey:,"b"" Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"""
Chandler:,"b' I\x92m talking about you. You big, big freak.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you\x92re out of your mind.'"
Chandler:,"b' Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you\nwere in a school yard you\x92d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual\nscenarios and stuff huh?!'"
Joey:,"b' Well, why don\x92t you tell me what you\x92re supposed to be! Huh?\nBecause I sure as hell can\x92t figure it out! I talk to you and it\x92s nothin\x92.\nYou look at me, and nothin\x92. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.'"
Joey:,b' Better?'
Joey:,"b' Ah, Kate? '"
Joey:,"b' You ah, you forgot your shoes.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, listen you ah....'"
Joey:,b' ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn\x92t it\nSpiderman? Y\x92know like Goldman, Silverman...'"
Chandler:,b' \x91Cause it\x92s-it\x92s not his last name.'
Phoebe:,b' It isn\x92t?'
Chandler:,"b"" No, it\x92s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He\x92s a spider, man.\nY'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there\x92s no Gold Man."""
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!'"
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey!'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn\x92t a chair.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I\x92m just gonna throw it\nout, it\x92s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)'"
Rachel:,b' (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take\na deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)'
Chandler:,"b' So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay well, he would turn things to gold.'"
Chandler:,b' What about things that are already gold?'
Phoebe:,"b' Ahh, his work is done.'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, let\x92s play my game now.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick\nup the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)'
