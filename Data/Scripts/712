Ross:,"b' Well, technically it started seven '"
Ross:,"b' Okay! Okay! Fine, I\x92ll stop! No teaching, okay? We\x92ll just watch\nthe pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don\x92t streak across the sky,\nmeteors do.) Okay? Who\x92s official name is Bapstein-King.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn\x92t Mother Nature\namazing?'"
Chandler:,b' (looking up with her) That\x92s a plane!'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that\x92s\npretty amazing too.'"
Rachel:,"b' No. No, you can\x92t.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh I don\x92t-I don\x92t know.'
Ross:,"b' Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from\nthe city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn\x92t it?'"
Joey:,b' (looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y\x92know what\nelse makes you wonder?'
Ross:,b' Huh?'
Joey:,b' Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross\nand finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and\nstarts looking for the comet.)'
Chandler:,"b' (with a quivering voice) No, I\x92m not!'"
Joey:,b' Then why are you wearing Monica\x92s jacket?'
Chandler:,b' Because it\x92s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on\nMonica! (He goes inside.)'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah actually, I think we\x92re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh! I won\x92t say, \x91no\x92 to a movie!'"
Rachel:,"b' Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.'"
Phoebe:,b' Shh! Get me out of here.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)'"
Joey:,b' (whispering) Ross!'
Ross:,b' What?'
Joey:,"b' Come here, check this out!'"
Ross:,b' What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey\x92s standing.)'
Joey:,"b' No! No-no. Look, there\x92s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down\nto get a closer look.)'"
Ross:,"b' Joey come\x97I can\x92t believe\x97I bring you here to see the\nBapstein-King comet, one of nature\x92s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care\nabout are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!'"
Joey:,"b' (standing up) Y\x92know, there\x92s '"
Ross:,b' Show me where?'
Joey:,b' Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)'
Ross:,b' (noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where\x92s the pipe\nthat was holding the door open?'
Joey:,"b' (annoyed) I don\x92t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)\n(Pause) Yeah, I do.'"
Ross:,b' Joey!'
Joey:,b' What?! All right\x97Hey! Don\x92t look at me! You\x92re the one who\nwanted to come up and look for some stupid '
Ross:,"b' It\x92s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)\nHey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! '"
Joey:,b' (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the\ndoor.)'
Chandler:,b' (whispering) Monica!'
Chandler:,"b' I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was '"
Chandler:,"b' Sorry, I just\x85can\x92t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and\nMonica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were\nice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I\nlook at that cover I\x92m like\x85(Fake snores.)'"
Chandler:,b' What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and\nheads into the living room.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don\x92t be a space\nship. Please don\x92t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and\nfinds that it\x92s the smoke detector that\x92s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a\nchair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she\nyanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets\nthere it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)\nHow could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Don\x92t interrupt me!!'
Ross:,b' Rachel!! Monica!!'
Joey:,b' Come on!'
Ross:,b' I can\x92t believe this!!'
Joey:,"b' All right well, y\x92know\x85I guess we know what we have to do to get\ndown.'"
Ross:,"b' (standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don\x92t have a\nchoice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We\x92re stuck up on the roof\nand we can\x92t get down!!!'"
Joey:,b' Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it\nout.)'
Ross:,"b' (To Joey) I know, I wasn\x92t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)\n(Yelling at the street) But don\x92t worry! We\x92re gonna go down the fire escape!!'"
Chandler:,"b' Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I\x92m sorry, I thought maybe I\x92d\nmake some warm milk and it would help me sleep.'"
Chandler:,b' It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what we can do? Y\x92know, now that we are up? We\ncan just like talk to each other all night long, y\x92know like we did when we were\nfirst going out. It\x92d be fun!'"
Chandler:,"b' Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?'"
Chandler:,"b' (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.'"
Chandler:,b' That\x92s correct.'
Rachel:,b' You wanna go in the bedroom? It\x92s a little more comfortable.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send\nthose contracts to Milan?'"
Rachel:,"b' No seriously, y\x92know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight\nthem?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that\nI don\x92t get.'
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He\nstarts laughing.) Tag! I\x92m serious! This isn\x92t funny! Those contracts absolutely\nhad to go out today!'"
Rachel:,b' Yes I did! And I put a little '
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those\ncontracts sitting on your desk.'"
Rachel:,b' Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on\nthe phone with your crotch!'
Rachel:,"b' No! Come on its late, we\x92re not gonna go down to the office.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel\nsuddenly stops and sticks her hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook\nthis? (Her bra.) Nice work!'
Joey:,"b' All right, it won\x92t go down any further. It\x92s stuck.'"
Ross:,"b' Ugh. Well, we\x92re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.\nNow, we\x92re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?\nNot hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish\nred stuff in the middle. So, when '"
Joey:,b' Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah! Oh yeah, you\x92ll be fine! It-it\x92ll be uh, just like bungy\njumping. Y\x92know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won\x92t.'"
Joey:,b' What if I smack my head on the concrete?'
Ross:,"b' Well, I\x92m not gonna lie to you Joey, it\x92s a possibility.'"
Joey:,"b' (looks at the ground and at Ross) I don\x92t know Ross! I-I tell you\nwhat, let\x92s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the\nlanding above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?'"
Joey:,b' No.'
Ross:,"b' Okay. Well, you be careful.'"
Joey:,"b' What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I\x92m not jumping! Okay, look I have an\naudition tomorrow and I can\x92t go if I break my leg.'"
Ross:,b' Well I\x92m not jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won\x92t have a father\nif-if I die!'
Joey:,"b' Well all right so, it looks like we\x92re even!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.\n(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to\ndo\x85 (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up\nand heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has\nstopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance\nto the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke\ndetector.) (Yelling.) '"
Chandler:,b' (startled) What? What? What?'
Rachel:,b' Oh '
Rachel:,"b' Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y\x92know what, the '"
Rachel:,"b' In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put\nthem on my desk, and then I put a '"
Rachel:,"b' Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don\x92t you um, check the copy room,\nmaybe you left the contracts in there?'"
Rachel:,b' I don\x92t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?\nIt\x92s not a perfect world! Just go please.'
Rachel:,b' Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom\ndrawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the\nphone.) I still don\x92t get it.'
Chandler:,b' Yeah! You?'
Chandler:,b' (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you\x92re not thinking\nabout cleaning the living room.'
Joey:,"b' Man, I\x92m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do\nyou want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!'"
Ross:,"b' (looking in the window behind them) Y\x92know, y\x92know I\x92m\nlookin\x92 and I don\x92t think anyone\x92s home here. I say we just break the\nwindow, crawl through, and-and y\x92know explain later.'"
Joey:,b' Yeah? Really? No one\x92s home?'
Ross:,"b' I don\x92t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,\nlarge, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the\nlanding.) When you get in there\x85 (Joey nods his disapproval.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the\nchute.) Noisy bitch!'"
Chandler:,b' Do you know what just happened?'
Chandler:,b' No. We were in the middle of sex\x85and '
Chandler:,b' (turning the light back on) Monica?'
Chandler:,"b' I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please\nwake up so '"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don\x92t fall asleep! Okay,\nI am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn\x92t move as he gets out of bed and as\nhe\x92s heading for the door.) And I probably won\x92t spill coffee grounds all over\nthe kitchen floor.'"
Rachel:,"b' Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh\x85 (She looks for a place to set it\non his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) \x85fair enough. So! Do\nyou got anything for me?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check '
Rachel:,"b' Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no\nit\x92s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one\nand he opens it. She doesn\x92t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)'"
Rachel:,"b' (thinks) Y\x92know, I don\x92t-I don\x92t know. Let me, let me\ncheck. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her shoulder at Tag, looks into\nher office, and finds the folder on her desk.)'"
Rachel:,b' Can I see you in my office for a minute?'
Rachel:,b' You put these on my desk!'
Rachel:,b' Oh really? So you\x92re saying they just '
Rachel:,b' (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I\nam so hot for you right now.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! How did you get back here?!'
Phoebe:,"b' (scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the\nblanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer\x97fireman, can-can I help you?'"
Phoebe:,b' That\x92s not mine.'
Phoebe:,b' How do you know?'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay do you\x97Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last\ntime I checked this was still America!'"
Phoebe:,b' Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them\nfrom going off!'
Phoebe:,"b' There\x92s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and\nshe goes to shut it off.) There\x92s a reset button! My God! Why didn\x92t I see that!\n(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,\nwhere is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)\nOh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to\nthe detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,\nGod!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, do-do you have a good grip?'"
Joey:,b' Yeah!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, I\x92m going to start climb down you now.'"
Joey:,b' All right! Just hurry up!'
Ross:,b' Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we\x92re face to\nface or-or should I climb down your back so we\x92re-we\x92re butt to face.'
Joey:,b' I think face to face.'
Ross:,b' I would say that.'
Joey:,"b' Face to face, yeah!'"
Ross:,"b' Okay, here I go.'"
Joey:,b' All right. '
Joey:,b' (grunting) Oh my\x85 How much do you weigh Ross?!'
Ross:,"b' I prefer not to answer that right now, I\x92m still carrying a little\nholiday weight.'"
Joey:,"b' Y\x92know, when we talked about face to face, I don\x92t think we\nthought it all the way through.'"
Ross:,b' So what do you want me to do?'
Joey:,"b' Well, just shimmy down me and drop!'"
Ross:,b' Hi.'
Joey:,b' Hi.'
Ross:,b' (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.'
Joey:,b' (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!'
Ross:,b' It\x92s still looks pretty far!'
Joey:,b' It\x92s not that far! Just drop!'
Ross:,b' Do not '
Joey:,"b' Ross, you should know that my pants are startin\x92 to come down and\nI\x92m not wearing any underwear!'"
Ross:,"b' Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when\nI\x97Ooh, a quarter!'"
Chandler:,"b' Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can\x92t believe that\nI\x92ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, you\x92re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven\nminutes\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Do you wanna?'
