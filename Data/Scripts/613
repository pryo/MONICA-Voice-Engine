Rachel:,"b' Wait a minute, you\x92re only giving free stuff away to the pretty\ngirls?'"
Phoebe:,b' Yeah Joey that is so gross!'
Joey:,b' How about a scone on the house baby?'
Phoebe:,b' (giggles) I\x92m pretty.'
Ross:,b' Hey does anyone have any gum?'
Phoebe:,"b' Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and\ntaking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y\x92know what? No.\n(Pause) Wait a second.

Phoebe:,b' (To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or\nthat\x92s bitter?'
Phoebe:,"b' Never mind, I got it.'"
Rachel:,b' Wow! What did he say?'

Joey:,b' What?!'
Joey:,"b' Well if it\x92s free food, how come you\x92re charging me for it?'"
Joey:,"b' Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?'"
Joey:,b' (to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her\nmuffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)'
Ross:,"b' Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your\ncredit card.'"
Ross:,b' I don\x92t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making\nit on your own.'
Phoebe:,"b' Seriously, I don\x92t Rachel\x92s gonna think it\x92s a good idea.'"
Phoebe:,b' I would '
Rachel:,b' (entering) Hey! What\x92s goin\x92 on?'
Rachel:,b' (notices Jill\x92s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!'
Rachel:,"b' You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it\nright under Jill\x92s nose when you know she\x92s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are\nterrible!'"
Phoebe:,b' Sorry Jill.'

Rachel:,"b' Oh, come on! You think that\x92s gonna work on me?! I invented that!'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, it\x92s okay. One little setback is okay, just don\x92t\nlet it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I '"
Ross:,"b' Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)'"
Ross:,b' Well. Hey\x85'

Chandler:,"b' I know, let\x92s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of\norange juice.)'"
Chandler:,b' That would be impossible to resist if you weren\x92t all drippy\nhere. (Points to his nose.)'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I don\x92t you should say that even when you\x92re healthy.'"
Chandler:,b' Don\x92t take this personally okay? It\x92s just that I just\ncan\x92t have sex with a sick person.'
Chandler:,"b' That\x92s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of\nmwha-ah-libe.'"
Rachel:,b' Hey!'
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Rachel:,b' What\x92s up?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Umm, I think there\x92s something you should maybe know.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well, it\x92d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just\npitched the idea to my boss at '"
Phoebe:,"b' No. No. It\x92s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you\nleft and umm, I\x92m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.'"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah I mean it\x92s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you\nthat there might be something there.'"
Rachel:,b' With Ross and Jill?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah!'
Rachel:,b' With Ross and my sister?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah.'
Rachel:,b' Oh there is no way.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay then.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don\x92t really like it\nwhen Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn\x92t that like incest or something?!\nOh my God, and they\x92re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this\nis just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can\x92t stop it! I can\x92t\x97I\ndon\x92t own Ross! Y\x92know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that\nshe wants to do! And oh my God, I can\x92t believe Ross is marrying my little sister,\nthis terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to\nme.'"
Phoebe:,b' But '
Joey:,b' That\x92ll be $3.85.'
Joey:,"b' It\x92s just I can\x92t because my manager said I\x85 (Gets an idea)\n(Starts singing) ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear\nAnnie\x85'"
Joey:,"b' (still singing) ""\x85Amy! Happy birthday to you!""'"
Joey:,"b' Yeah, not it here it isn\x92t.'"
Rachel:,"b' (on the couch) Oh hi! Y\x92know, I just wanted to see if there were\nany leads on the old job front.'"
Rachel:,"b' That is great. Hey, y\x92know who doesn\x92t have to job hunt? Ross.\nHe works at the university. '"
Rachel:,"b' Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so\nyou think you\x92re gonna go out?'"

Rachel:,b' Are-are you saying he\x92s a geek?'
Rachel:,"b' No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!'"
Rachel:,b' What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those\nthings aren\x92t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!'

Rachel:,"b' Yeah but, he\x92s not your type.'"
Rachel:,"b' Yeah but, you don\x92t, you don\x92t, you don\x92t want to try to\nmuch too fast. Y\x92know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that\ntried to much too fast don\x92t you?'"
Rachel:,b' She-she died Jill.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from\nthe couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively\non the bed. Or at least she\x92s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the\nrobe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.'"
Chandler:,b' I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no!\nNo-no honey! Y\x92know what\x92s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy.\nAnd oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.'
Chandler:,b' Would you please get some rest!'

Rachel:,b' Well yeah\x85'
Ross:,"b' Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she\x92s cute but I-I would\nnever have thought of going out with her, never!'"
Rachel:,b' Really?!'
Ross:,"b' Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!""'"
Rachel:,b' Oh so-so not really never.'
Ross:,"b' I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all\nwe\x92ve been through, I just\x97y\x92know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.\nHey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.'"
Joey:,"b' (overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!'"
Chandler:,b' Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!'
Chandler:,"b' No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.'"
Chandler:,b' No-no-no-no-no!'
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,"b' So you\x92re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?'"
Chandler:,b' It\x92s nice.'
Chandler:,b' Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)'
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you\nwanna go uh, mix it up?'"
Chandler:,b' Oh come on you big faker!'
Chandler:,b' Well that was before all the vaporizing action.'

Rachel:,b' It\x92s kinda slutty.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah well, I\x92m-I\x92m a slut.'"
