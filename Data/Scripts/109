Rachel:,"b"" Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was\nwondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"""
Rachel:,"b"" It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we\ngo skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the\nwhole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm\ntrying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?\n(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that."""
Rachel:,"b"" Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do\nyou think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.\n(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. """
Ross:,"b"" No, they're not."""
Ross:,"b"" You're wrong."""
Ross:,"b"" You're wrong."""
Ross:,"b"" (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom."""
Joey:,"b' Hey, hey.'"
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Phoebe:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?'
Joey:,"b' Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.'"
Chandler:,"b"" That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey\nTribbiani, man slash woman."""
Phoebe:,b' What were you modeling for?'
Joey:,b' You know those posters for the city free clinic?'
Phoebe:,"b' You know, the asthma guy was really cute.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Do you know which one you're gonna be?"""
Joey:,"b' No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) '"
Chandler:,"b' Good luck, man. I hope you get it.'"
Joey:,b' Thanks.'
Ross:,"b"" (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's\nThanksgiving. """
Ross:,b' Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?'
Joey:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, every single one of them.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December\n'cause he is lunar."""
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. Oh, can I come?'"
Rachel:,"b' Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.'"
Chandler:,b' I thought it was $98.50.'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.'"
Ross:,"b"" Well, I'm off to Carol's."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"""
Ross:,"b"" (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to\nbring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."""
Ross:,"b' Hi, is uh, is Carol here?'"
Ross:,"b' Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...'"
Ross:,"b' Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to\nthe museum.'"
Ross:,b' Kinda like a big face without skin.'
Ross:,"b"" Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about\nbein' a lesbian."""
Ross:,"b' (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.'"
Ross:,"b"" The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...\ncrazy?"""
Ross:,"b"" You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"""
Ross:,"b' Do you uh, do you talk about me?'"
Ross:,b' Really?'
Ross:,"b"" Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly\ntime too. Not that I believe any of this."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can\nshow you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,\nand then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."""
Chandler:,"b"" I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,\nI'd very much like to butter your head."""
Rachel:,"b' No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,\nshoop, shoop.'"
Rachel:,"b' Thanks, you can just put it on the table.'"
Rachel:,"b' Thanks, you can just put it on the table.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.'"
Joey:,b' (to Monica) We did?'
Rachel:,b' Thank you. Thank you so much!'
Rachel:,"b"" Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving\ndinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"""
Chandler:,"b"" All right, I'm nine years old."""
Ross:,"b' Oh, I hate this story.'"
Chandler:,"b"" We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I\nremember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents\nchoose to tell me they're getting divorced."""
Rachel:,b' Oh my god.'
Chandler:,"b"" Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once\nyou've seen it in reverse."""
Joey:,"b' Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.'"
Joey:,"b"" Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.\n(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? """
Joey:,"b"" I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business."""
Joey:,"b"" I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."""
Joey:,"b"" Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"""
Joey:,"b' Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?'"
Joey:,"b"" What's wrong?"""
Joey:,b' Oh. What?'
Joey:,"b' Wait, wait, wait!'"
Joey:,b' So I guess you all saw it.'
Rachel:,b' Saw what?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.'"
Joey:,b' Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.'
Chandler:,"b' Tonight, on a very special Blossom.'"
Ross:,"b"" I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen."""
Ross:,"b"" That's closer."""
Rachel:,"b' I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,\nshoop.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, you must stop shooping.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."""
Joey:,"b' Chandler, will you just come in already?'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not\nfunny anymore."""
Joey:,"b"" Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."""
Joey:,"b"" But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little\npiece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't\nbe with my family because of my disease."""
Ross:,"b"" Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. """
Ross:,"b' Ok, Mom never hit.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (stirring pot) Ok, all done.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then\nadd some peas and onions."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,\nbefore she died."""
Rachel:,"b' Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and\nhits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!'"
Chandler:,b' The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten\naway.'
Joey:,b' The balloon?'
Chandler:,"b"" No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all\nover the news. Right before he reached """
Rachel:,"b"" I can't, I gotta go."""
Chandler:,b' Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often\ndoes that happen?'
Phoebe:,b' Almost never.'
Rachel:,b' Ok.'
Ross:,"b' Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I\ntalking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain\nacoustical advantage, but...'"
Ross:,"b"" Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this\nis too weird. I feel stupid."""
Ross:,"b' (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.'"
Rachel:,b' I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the\npark.'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.'"
Rachel:,"b"" We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys."""
Rachel:,"b' Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""'"
Rachel:,"b' No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".'"
Chandler:,b' Do either of you '
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I gotta get my ticket!'"
Joey:,"b' Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.'"
Joey:,b' That tone will not make me go any faster.'
Joey:,b' That one will. '
Ross:,"b"" And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.\nSo, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's\nface it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."""
Ross:,"b' Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?'"
Ross:,b' Shh! (singing) '
Ross:,"b' Does it always, uh--?'"
Ross:,b' (singing) '
Ross:,b' (singin) '
Joey:,"b' Nope, not that one.'"
Joey:,"b' Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.'"
Chandler:,b' (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.'
Rachel:,"b"" (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't\nfor you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a\ngesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not."""
Rachel:,"b"" No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I\nobviously didn't have the keys."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."""
Rachel:,b' Aside from the fact that you said you had them?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, you should have.'"
Rachel:,b' Because!'
Rachel:,b' Because!'
Chandler:,"b"" Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.\nHere we go."""
Ross:,"b"" Here we come, walkin' down the\x97this doesn't smell like Mom's."""
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck\nhere with you guys."""
Joey:,"b"" Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."""
Joey:,b' You call that delicious? '
Chandler:,b' Now this feels like Thanksgiving.'
Phoebe:,b' Ooh. '
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not\nalone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal."""
Joey:,"b"" I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" It's nice that he has someone."""
Chandler:,b' Shall I carve?'
Rachel:,b' By all means.'
Chandler:,"b' Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?'"
Ross:,"b"" I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese."""
Joey:,"b' Oh, I will.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd\nyou wish for?"""
Joey:,b' The bigger half.'
Chandler:,"b"" I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this\nisn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been\nreally great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.\nAnyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with\nyour family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings\nsucked."""
Ross:,"b"" And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."""
Rachel:,b' And a crappy New Year.'
Chandler:,"b' Here, here!'"
