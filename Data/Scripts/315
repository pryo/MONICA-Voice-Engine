Joey:,"b"" Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your\neyes. Y'know, because you don\x92t want to be doing something and then look up and see\nsomething you don\x92t want to be seeing."""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are\nclosed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab\nsomething with his hand.)'"

Rachel:,"b' Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my\njob so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?'"
Ross:,"b' No, but it\x92d be nice if you realised, it\x92s just a job!'"
Rachel:,b' '
Ross:,b' Yes.'
Rachel:,b' Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I\x92m doing\nsomething I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I\x92m doing\nsomething that I\x92m actually good at. I mean. if you don\x92t get that...'
Ross:,"b' No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I\x92m happy for ya,\nbut I\x92m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I\ndon\x92t know what to do anymore.'"

Joey:,"b' Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.'"
Chandler:,b' Why? What happened to him?'
Joey:,"b' Nothing, he\x92s just really believes in that.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.\nI told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted\nto take a break, I don\x92t want to take a break.'"
