Chandler:,b' Me?! Why me?'
Phoebe:,"b' Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him\nscared like you! Make him a\x85man!'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm\na lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."""
Chandler:,"b"" (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of\nit. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he\nnods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)"""

Chandler:,b' You mean scared.'
Chandler:,b' Scared? Happy?'
Chandler:,"b"" I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived\nwith Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to\nbed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"""
Chandler:,"b"" Were you're parents happy, or something?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."""

Phoebe:,b' Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Phoebe:,b' Uh-hmm.'

Ross:,"b"" It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"""
Chandler:,"b"" It's throwing and catching!"""
Ross:,b' All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)'
Chandler:,"b"" Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control\nand almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)"""

Rachel:,"b"" I tried! They won't take her back."""
Chandler:,"b"" Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ."""
Rachel:,"b' Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,\nwhat am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?'"
Rachel:,"b"" No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all\nscratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)"""
