Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Chandler:,b' I broke up with her. '
Ross:,"b' Don\x92t tell me, because of the big nostril thing?'"
Chandler:,"b' They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.'"
Rachel:,"b' Come on, they were not that huge.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain."""
Joey:,"b"" Hold it, hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first\nmoved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser,\nbut she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts."""
Chandler:,b' (To Ross) You or me?'
Ross:,"b"" I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."""
Joey:,"b' You guys are messing with me, right?'"
Joey:,"b' That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa.""'"
Phoebe:,b' You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.'
Chandler:,b' Maureen Rosilla.'
Ross:,"b' ""\x92Cause she doesn\x92t hate Yanni,"" is not a real reason.'"
Rachel:,"b"" You don't have birds."""
Rachel:,"b' All right, bye-bye.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about\nbeing picky."""
Ross:,"b"" We'll give you Janice."""
Phoebe:,"b' I miss Janice though. (Imitating Janice) ""Hello, Chandler\nBing.""'"
Rachel:,"b' (doing Janice) ""Oh, my, god.""'"
Joey:,"b' (doing Janice) ""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that\'s it. There,\nfaster!"" (He turns around and everyone is staring at him.)'"
Rachel:,b' We won. We won!'
Rachel:,b' How did this happen?'
Ross:,"b' Sure, you coulda. You never know.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.\n(Screaming) Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"""
Chandler:,"b' Ok, Phoebe.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. (Everyone groans) That's fine.\nGo ahead and scoff. You know there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that\ndoesn't mean they're not true."""
Joey:,b' Such as?'
Phoebe:,"b' Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?'"
Ross:,"b"" Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"""
Phoebe:,b' Nah. Not really.'
Ross:,"b"" You don't believe in evolution?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a,\nit's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy."""
Ross:,"b' Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving\nover millions of years from single-celled organisms, is-is too easy?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Yeah, I just don't buy it."""
Ross:,"b' Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is\nscientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, don't get me started on gravity."""
Ross:,"b"" You uh, you don't believe in gravity?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you\nknow, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled\ndown as I am being pushed."""
Chandler:,"b"" Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed."""
Rachel:,"b"" Ok, so let's talk money."""
Rachel:,b' Have you ever seen so much crap?'
Chandler:,"b' Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap'"
Joey:,b' Check this out. Can I have this? (It\x92s a giant magnifying glass on a\nstand.)'
Ross:,b' How can you not believe in evolution?'
Phoebe:,"b"" Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!"""
Ross:,"b' Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you,\nwe have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of\ndifferent species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.'"
Phoebe:,b' Really? You can actually see it?'
Ross:,"b' You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" See, I didn't know that."""
Ross:,"b' Well, there you go.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?'"
Chandler:,"b' (holding a book) Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of\nGrievances.""'"
Joey:,"b"" Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with\na date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."""
Chandler:,"b"" April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home\nwith the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent."""
Rachel:,"b' Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. (She\x92s holding a lamp made from\nseashells.) Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.'"
Rachel:,"b"" What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girlie clock or\nanything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool. (It\x92s a girl in a bikini and\npasties standing behind an alarm clock.)"""
Rachel:,"b' Well, what about my stuff?'"
Rachel:,"b"" You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"""
Rachel:,"b"" Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who\nrents a room."""
Rachel:,"b' Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I\'m gonna go find a\nplace for my new lamp.'"
Ross:,"b"" Ok, Pheebs. (He\x92s holding two little toys.) See how I'm making these\nlittle toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable\nthumbs?"""
Phoebe:,b' Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.'
Ross:,"b"" Please tell me you're joking."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."""
Ross:,"b"" No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because\x97"""
Phoebe:,"b"" What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you?\nNo, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the\nmicroscope."""
Ross:,b' (To Chandler) Is there blood coming out of my ears?'
Joey:,"b"" Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook."""
Chandler:,"b' Wow, he looks so normal.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" He's even kind of cute."""
Joey:,"b' ""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You\'re the funniest kid\nin school.""'"
Chandler:,b' Funniest? Heckles? '
Joey:,"b"" That's what it says."""
Chandler:,"b' Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. (There\x92s a\nbanging coming from upstairs.) He was right. Would you listen to that?'"
Phoebe:,"b"" I'd call that excessive."""
Chandler:,b' Whoa! '
Joey:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in\nthe scale modeler\x92s club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they\nwere cool.'"
Joey:,"b' So, you were both dorks. Big deal.'"
Chandler:,"b"" I just think it's weird, you know? (The banging is back.) Heckles and\nme, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles\x85 (He picks up the broom and bangs on the ceiling)\nWould you knock it off? (Everyone stares) (Realizes) Bah! (He throws the broom down.)"""
Joey:,b' (entering) Have you been here all night?'
Chandler:,"b"" Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with.\nLook what he wrote on them. (As he mentions each name and description, he hands a picture\nto Joey.) Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she\neats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."""
Joey:,"b' Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30\nyears behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit\nJunction."""
Joey:,"b"" All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come\non, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go."""
Chandler:,"b"" What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I\ndumped her because she pronounced it \x91supposably?\x92"""
Joey:,"b"" Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."""
Chandler:,b' How do you know that? How?'
Joey:,"b"" I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."""
Chandler:,"b"" You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm\ngonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me\nover for holidays?"""
Joey:,"b"" Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what\nif we're at her folks' place?"""
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I understand.'"
Joey:,"b' You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?'"
Chandler:,"b"" You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man."""
Joey:,b' Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.'
Chandler:,"b"" (on phone) Hi, it's me."""
Phoebe:,b' Janice? You called Janice?'
Chandler:,"b' Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?'"
Ross:,"b' You remember Janice, right?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me.\nJanice is my last chance to have somebody.'"
Chandler:,b' Oh\x85my\x85God!'
Joey:,"b' (To Chandler) Geez, look how fat she got.'"
Chandler:,"b"" Janice, you're\x85"""
Chandler:,b' Is it\x85'
Chandler:,b' Congratulations.'
Chandler:,"b"" You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?"""
Rachel:,b' What?'
Rachel:,"b' Monica, let it go.'"
Rachel:,"b"" Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man."""
Ross:,"b' Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.\nA briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.'"
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just\nsaying that it's one of the possibilities."""
Ross:,"b"" It's the only possibility, Phoebe."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? (Holding her\nthumb and forefinger close together) Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the\nworld believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all\nthought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole\nmess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that\nyou can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?\n(Monica and Rachel are intrigued.)"""
Ross:,b' There might be\x85a teeny\x85tiny\x85possibility.'
Phoebe:,"b"" I can't believe you caved."""
Ross:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b"" You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't\nagree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work\ntomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to\nface yourself? (Ross slowly closes the briefcase and walks out hugging it.) Oh! That was\nfun. So who's hungry?"""
Rachel:,b' I am. Let me just get my coat.'
Rachel:,b' (running into the living room) What happened?! What happened?!'
Rachel:,"b"" Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a\nsudden, it's just magically broken?"""
Phoebe:,"b"" Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want\nto believe you."""
Rachel:,b' Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.'
Chandler:,"b"" Neat. I'm gonna die alone."""
Rachel:,"b' Ok, you win.'"
Chandler:,"b' Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.'"
Phoebe:,b' Uh huh. Why is that?'
Chandler:,"b' If I\'m gonna be an old, lonely man, I\'m gonna need a thing, you know,\na hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I\'ll be Crazy Man\nwith a Snake, y\x92know. Crazy Snake Man. And I\'ll get more snakes, call them my babies,\nkids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,""\nthey\'ll shout!'"
Chandler:,"b"" Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out\nwith me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."""
Rachel:,"b' Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever\ngone out with.'"
Rachel:,"b"" She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them."""
Chandler:,b' In a bad way?'
Rachel:,"b"" Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone."""
Phoebe:,"b"" Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with\nsomeone!"""
Phoebe:,"b"" You're there!"""
Rachel:,b' You are ready to make a commitment!'
Chandler:,"b"" Whoa! Don't know about that."""
Rachel:,"b"" What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?"""
Rachel:,b' Thank you.'
Chandler:,"b"" Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow\nnight. This woman Alison, from work, she's great. She's pretty. She's smart. And uh, I've\nbeen holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head.\nBut, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing."""
Joey:,"b"" Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"""
Chandler:,"b"" I'll take that."""
Joey:,b' You want his yearbook?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think\nsomebody should have it.'"
Rachel:,"b"" It's really not that big!"""
Chandler:,"b"" (To Joey) Takin' that with you, huh?"""
Joey:,"b' Oh, yeah.'"
Ross:,"b"" You comin'?"""
Chandler:,"b"" Yeah, just second. (Ross exits and Chandler picks up the broom and\nleans it up against the wall.) Good-bye Mr. Heckles. (He turns off the lights.) We'll try\nto keep it down."""
Chandler:,b' Sure. (In his head.) '
