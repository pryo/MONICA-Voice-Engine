Joey:,"b"" Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a\nreal big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."""
Chandler:,"b"" I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big\nhotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"""
Joey:,"b"" Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right\nin Joey's pocket."""
Chandler:,"b"" So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?"""
Joey:,"b' Did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""She\'s been dead for ten\nyears."" I\'m gonna be a millionaire!'"

Chandler:,"b"" We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road\nonce."""
Joey:,"b"" Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly\nlooks at the road.) I think I just need lunch."""
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,b' You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!'
