Joey:,"b' Uh, I think he\x92s in Rachel\x92s room. See ya. (Exits.)'"
Ross:,b' (going up to Rachel\x92s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and\nlooks inside and doesn\x92t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still\ndoesn\x92t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)'
Ross:,b' Hey! '
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Ross:,"b' Is uh, is Monica here?'"
Rachel:,"b' She\x92s steaming her dress, why? What\x92s up?'"
Ross:,b' I think Chandler\x92s gone. (He hands her the note.)'
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Ross:,b' He left that.'
Rachel:,b' (reading the note) Tell Monica I\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe:,b' (walking up) What\x92s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads\nit.) Tell Monica I\x92m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! Chandler just left though!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah but, maybe it\x92s not what we think. Maybe it\x92s tell Monica\nI\x92m sorry I\x85drank the last of the milk.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he\x92s changed his\nname, y\x92know? Tell Monica I\x92m sorry.'"
Ross:,b' I think it means he freaked out and left!'
Phoebe:,b' Don\x92t be so negative! Good God! Isn\x92t it possible that Sorry\nis sitting in there (Joey and Rachel\x92s apartment) right now?!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?'"
Ross:,"b' Look\x97Okay, I\x92m just gonna\x97I\x92m gonna have to go find\nhim and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' (pointing at Ross) Okay '
Ross:,"b' (scared) I will, I will find him.'"
Joey:,b' Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!'
Joey:,b'  Alright.'
Joey:,b' Picture? What picture?'

Ross:,"b' Well then, we\x92ll-we\x92ll see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks\naway slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (They\x92re sitting by the window.)\nWhat-what\x85what you guys doing here?!'"
Ross:,b' Why?!'
Ross:,b' (shocked) Gunther?!'
Ross:,b' What? Your-your list?'
Ross:,"b' Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see\nChandler, could you just let him know I\x92m looking for him?'"

Joey:,"b' Oh, I\x92m-I\x92m not working tomorrow.'"
Joey:,b' No! No! I can\x92t! You gotta get me out of it! I\x92ve got plans!\n(Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)'
Rachel:,b' (closing the door) Ross said there\x92s still no word from Chandler.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh man.'
Rachel:,b' Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth\navenue.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. Well there\x92s one down.'
Phoebe:,b' Y\x92know she might not even notice he\x92s gone.'
Rachel:,"b' God! Don\x92t\x97We can\x92t let her start getting ready! This is\ntoo awful! Oh God, but wait she\x92ll be in the gown and then he won\x92t show up and\nthen she\x92s gonna have to take off the gown\x85'"
Phoebe:,b' Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can\x92t do this here! (She drags\nher into the bathroom.)'
Rachel:,b' I\x92m sorry. I\x92m sorry. It\x92s just\x85It\x92s just so\nsad!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, but you\x92ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can\x92t\nsee you like this! Then she\x92ll know something\x92s wrong!'"
Rachel:,b' I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There\x92s no tissue! Can you\ngrab me some toilet paper?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that\x92s gone too. This '"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Phoebe:,b' No-no! I-I\x85I found one.'
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have\nanother one?'
Phoebe:,b' (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you\nneed some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)'
Rachel:,b' Oh God I just cannot imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler\ndoesn\x92t show up!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh here\x92s a whole bunch.'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, I mean she\x92s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people\nwill be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."" Y\x92know? Then she\x92ll have to\ncome back here and live all alone.'"
Phoebe:,b' (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,"b' There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it\x92s positive.\nMonica\x92s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won\x92t be totally\nalone.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!'
Phoebe:,"b' I know! Monica\x92s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her\nsomething new?'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God!'
Phoebe:,"b' Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?'"
Rachel:,"b' No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash\nlast night.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is\npregnant. The groom is missing. And I\x92m still holding this. (She throws the test back\ninto the trash.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.'"
Phoebe:,b' Right.'
Rachel:,b' Okay?'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was\nusing?'"
Rachel:,b' No. Why?'
Phoebe:,"b' Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.'"
Rachel:,b' Anything?'
Ross:,"b' No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn\x92t heard from him. I-I-I\ntalked to Chandler\x92s parents again!'"
Phoebe:,b' You told them he was missing?'
Ross:,"b' No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both\nthink I\x92m interested in them.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, we\x92ve got to tell her he\x92s gone. (Starts to leave.)'"
Ross:,b' No! Hey! Hey! We can\x92t!'
Rachel:,"b' Ross, she\x92s gonna start getting ready soon!'"
Ross:,"b' Well, can\x92t you at least stall her a little? I\x92ll-I\x92ll go\nback to some of the places I went last night.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, well how much time do you need?'"
Ross:,b' Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?'
Rachel:,b' One hour.'
Ross:,b' Give me two.'
Rachel:,b' Then why do you ask?!'
Ross:,"b' Okay, wish me luck.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay. I\x92m going with you.'
Ross:,b' Why?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Ross, you\x92re tired. You\x92ve been looking all night. And clearly\nyou suck at this.'"
Rachel:,"b' All right, I\x92ll see you guys later.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Wait, do you know how you\x92re going to stall her?'"
Rachel:,b' I\x92ll figure something out.'
Phoebe:,b' All right. Good luck.'
Rachel:,b' Thanks.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.'"
Rachel:,b' Umm\x85 I\x92m never gonna getting married!'
Rachel:,"b' No Monica! I\x92m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.\nBecome a lesbian or something.'"
Rachel:,b' Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.'
Joey:,"b' Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little\nproblem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn\x92t supposed to work today, and I have\nthis wedding that I really have to be at. It\x92s my best friend\x92s, and I\x92m\nofficiating so I really can\x92t work past four.'"
Joey:,b' I\x92m having surgery!'
Joey:,"b' Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn\x92t\nwant you to worry about me. But, I\x92m having surgery today.'"
Joey:,b' Transplant.'
Joey:,b' Hair transplant.'
Joey:,b' It\x92s not on my head.'
Joey:,"b' Hey! You\x92re here! Great! Great! Great! Let\x92s get going buddy,\nwe\x92ve got a scene to shoot!'"
Joey:,b' Are you drunk?'
Joey:,b' Yes you are!'
Ross:,b' We are never gonna find him! He\x92s one guy in a huge city!'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)'
Ross:,"b' That is an old, Chinese woman!'"
Phoebe:,"b' He could be in disguise, y\x92know.'"
Ross:,"b' Aw, y\x92know\x85Y\x92know, maybe we\x92re-we\x92re just\napproaching this all wrong. If you\x92re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the\nlast place on Earth people would think you\x92d go?'"
Ross:,b' So this is your office?'
Chandler:,b' How did you guys find me? I knew I should\x92ve hid at the gym!'
Phoebe:,b' What the hell are you doing?!'
Chandler:,b' Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I\x92m\nrelated to Monica. How is she?'
Ross:,"b' She\x92s fine. She doesn\x92t know you\x92re gone. And she\ndoesn\x92t have to know, okay? Now come on, we\x92re going home.'"
Chandler:,b' No! No! No! I can\x92t do that!'
Phoebe:,b' Why not?!'
Chandler:,"b' Because if I go home, we\x92re gonna become the Bings! I can\x92t\nbe the Bings!'"
Ross:,b' What\x92s wrong with being the Bings?'
Chandler:,b' The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use\nthe pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!'
Ross:,"b' Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to\nyour hotel room?'"
Chandler:,b' No.'
Ross:,b' Then you are neither of your parents!'
Chandler:,"b' It\x92s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at\neverybody\x92s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And\nI\x92ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don\x92t race cars! I don\x92t make popcorn!\nNone of my proceeds go to charity.'"
Phoebe:,"b' But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I\ndo. But I totally believe you can do this.'"
Chandler:,"b' I want to. I love her so much, but I\x92m afr\x85It\x92s too\nhuge.'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know, okay. You\x92re right. It is huge. So why don\x92t we\ntake it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just\nforget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well yeah, but then\x85'"
Ross:,"b' (interrupting him) Yeah\x97No-but-but-but-but! We\x92re just gonna go\nhome and take a shower. Now, that\x92s not scary right?'"
Chandler:,b' Depends on what you mean by we.'
Rachel:,b' The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!\nAnd that\x92s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again\x85'
Rachel:,b' I know. At dusk. That\x92s such a hard time for me.'
Rachel:,b' Okay. But wait!'
Rachel:,b' Let\x92s go to lunch.'
Rachel:,b' Right.'
Rachel:,b' Oh good God! I\x92ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)'
Rachel:,"b' Okay. Alright. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I\x92m\nabout to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love\nyou.'"
Rachel:,b' We can\x92t find Chandler\x85(Phoebe sticks her head and motions\nthat they found Chandler)\x97\x91s vest. We can\x92t find Chandler\x92s vest.'
Phoebe:,"b' (entering) Found the vest! I mean we\x92re gonna have to keep an eye\non it, y\x92know make sure we don\x92t lose it again\x85'"
Rachel:,b' Oh!'
Joey:,b' I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!'
Joey:,b' What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!'
Joey:,"b' Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And\nI\x92m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?'"
Joey:,b' Thank you. Thank you.'
Joey:,b' I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!'
Phoebe:,b' So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God Monica!'
Rachel:,b' You look so beautiful.'
Rachel:,b' Hello?'
Joey:,b' (on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, we got him back. Everything\x92s fine.'"
Joey:,b' Damnit!'

Rachel:,b' Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!'
Joey:,"b' I know! I\x92m sorry! The guy\x92s drunk, they won\x92t let me go\nuntil we get this.'"
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! I\x92m gonna have to find another minister.'
Joey:,"b' No! No, I\x92m the minister! Alright, look-look, put \x91em both on\nthe phone, I\x92ll marry them right now.'"
Rachel:,"b' Ugh! Joey, I have to go.'"
Joey:,b' Hey! Don\x92t you hang up on me! I\x92ll marry you and me right now! I\nhave the power!'
Ross:,"b' There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn\x92t so scary, was it?'"
Chandler:,b' No.'
Ross:,"b' I\x92m telling you, just a little bit at a time.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah okay. Well, what\x92s the next little bit?'"
Ross:,"b' Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that\ntoo! Just like you\x92ve done everything else!'"
Chandler:,b' Yeah. You\x92re right. Hey I-I can do that.'

Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a\nflight risk?!'
Joey:,b' Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy\x92s hammered!'
Joey:,"b' So I uh, I just talked to the director. That\x92s it, we\x92re done\nfor the day.'"

Ross:,b' (turning a corner) There he is!!'
Chandler:,b' What?'

Chandler:,b' Ross! (He starts to get up.)'
Ross:,b' Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) I\x92m serious! You\x92re not\nwalking out on my sister!'
Chandler:,b' (standing up) That\x92s right! I\x92m not!'
Ross:,b' Then where the hell have you been?!'
Chandler:,b' I know about Monica.'
Phoebe:,b' You know?!'
Ross:,b' What?'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.'"
Ross:,b' What?! What?! Talking about what?!'
Chandler:,b' You don\x92t know?'

Chandler:,b' Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of\ncigarettes\x85'
Chandler:,"b' Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that\x92s when I\nuh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.)\nYeah, y\x92know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can\x92t be scary.'"
Phoebe:,b' Well you obviously didn\x92t see Chucky 3.'
Chandler:,"b' But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give\nMonica so she\x92d know I was okay.'"
Ross:,b' Dude. (Hugs him.)'
Chandler:,"b"" You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look\nbeautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I\x92m so glad you're\nhere. (He kisses his mom.)"""
Chandler:,b' Are you Joey?'
Ross:,b' Huh. This is nice.'
Phoebe:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' I\x92ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can\x92t end in\ndivorce.'
Chandler:,b' You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)'
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,b' (in Monica\x92s ear) He\x92s Greek Orthodox.'
Rachel:,b' (leaning in) As are you\x85'
Joey:,"b' (entering) That\x92s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I\ncan take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I\x92m sorry I\x92m a little\nlate. You may be confused by this now, (He\x92s still in costume) but you won\x92t be\nMemorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let\x92s get started before the groom takes off again.\nHuh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man\nand this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I\x92ve known Monica and Chandler for a\nlong time, and I can '"
Rachel:,b' Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)'
Joey:,b' Chandler?'
Chandler:,"b' (To Ross) No, that\x92s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I\nthought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I\nsaw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises\nthat come our way, it\x92s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was\nmeant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I\x92m sure? (He leans in and\nkisses her.)'"
Joey:,"b' You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in\nme by the\nstate of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do\nyou take each other?'"
Chandler:,b' I do.'
Joey:,b' Yeah you do!'
Ross:,b' Rings?'
Joey:,b' Aw crap! Okay\x97uh\x85uh let\x92s-let\x92s do the rings. '
Joey:,"b' We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To\nChandler) Now kiss her again.'"
Chandler:,b' (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.'
Chandler:,b' Our baby.'
Chandler:,b' Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.'
Chandler:,b' Then\x85who did?'
Phoebe:,b' Oh and they\x92re gonna have a baby.'
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
