Joey:,b' Hey!'
Ross:,b' Hi!'
Joey:,b' Who wants French toast?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I\x92ll have some!'"
Joey:,"b' Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge.\nThanks.'"
Chandler:,b' What\x92s the matter honey?'
Phoebe:,b' It starts?'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, so let\x92s get started on the wedding plans!'"
Chandler:,b' (incredulous) Already?!'
Rachel:,"b' Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the\ncaterers, the music\x85'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I got some thoughts on that.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks\x85'"
Ross:,"b' Take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say\nthe right name.'"
Chandler:,b' What in God\x92s name is that?!'
Ross:,"b' Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven\x92t seen that since the forth\ngrade!'"
Phoebe:,"b' That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it\noff now.'"
Ross:,b' And '
Phoebe:,b' Hey! Ross!'
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I need to talk to you, it\x92s pretty urgent. It\x92s about Monica\nand Chandler.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please\nexcuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other\x92s hometowns? Why don\x92t\nyou\x85 (Motions that they should learn everyone\x92s hometown.) (To Phoebe)\nWh-what\x92s going on?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just\ngot engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y\x92know? So, could I\njust move in with you for a couple days?'"
Ross:,"b' Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what\x92s wrong with Monica and Chandler?'"
Phoebe:,b' Nothing\x97Why?!'
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, you said it was urgent!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh yeah it is! I\x92m going to the movies and it starts in like five\nminutes.'
Ross:,b' Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?'
Phoebe:,"b' (to the students) Oh, I\x92m sorry. I\x92m so rude. Does anyone want\nto come to the movies?'"
Rachel:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' Aw.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, you couldn\x92t get them anyway. Ian doesn\x92t\nplay anymore\nand Derrick\x85 (Off of Rachel and Monica\x92s looks) And Derrick is a name I\nshouldn\x92t know.'"
Joey:,"b' (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up\none.) Y\x92know, something a little snugglyer?'"
Chandler:,b' Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?'
Joey:,"b' Well, the duck\x85'"
Rachel:,b' What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!'
Joey:,"b' Uh, well he did '"
Chandler:,"b' Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are\nactually '"
Chandler:,b' Okay.'
Chandler:,b' Centerpieces!'
Chandler:,"b' Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just\nthink they\x92re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)\nBut Lilies are the clear choice.'"
Chandler:,b' Uh-huh!'
Joey:,b' (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You '
Rachel:,"b' Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!'"
Joey:,"b' Yes it is perfectly good, and it is '"
Rachel:,b' What?!'
Joey:,"b' All right, I\x92m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Now Joey, what did the duck do?!'"
Joey:,b' I don\x92t know! But he did '
Joey:,"b' Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does '"
Ross:,"b' Uh, Phoebe\x85'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh Ross, hi.'"
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, what are you doing?'"
Phoebe:,"b' I\x92m sorry, I\x92m with a client right now.'"
Ross:,b' Phoebe!'
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, let\x92s talk outside.'"
Ross:,"b' Phoebe, you can\x92t massage people in my apartment!'"
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler\x92s!'
Ross:,b' And they knew about it?'
Phoebe:,"b' (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?'"
Ross:,"b' Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I\nwant!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I\njust don\x92t know what the big deal is!'"
Ross:,"b' The big deal is I don\x92t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment\nwhen I want to kick back with a puzzle\x97beer! Cold beer.'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey Joey, what \x91cha doing?'"
Joey:,b' Sweepin\x92. Why? Turn you on?'
Rachel:,b' No.'
Joey:,b' Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, did '"
Joey:,b' Where are you going? The vicar won\x92t be home for hours.'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?'"
Joey:,"b' Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?'"
Rachel:,b' (gasps) You found my book?!'
Joey:,b' Yeah I did!'
Rachel:,"b' Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!'"
Joey:,"b' Okay, look I\x92m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I\nshouldn\x92t have, but you got porn!'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey-hey, y\x92know what? I don\x92t care! I\x92m not ashamed of my\nbook. There\x92s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little\x85erotica. It\x92s just a\nhealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She\ngoes into her room.)'"
Joey:,b' You got porn!'
Ross:,b' Hello.'
Ross:,"b' Uh no-no, she-she\x92s out for the night.'"
Ross:,"b' Can I, can I help you with something?'"
Ross:,b' (deadpan) Yes I am.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, I should probably call them.'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t think I ever heard that story.'"
Chandler:,b' What a sweet story.'
Chandler:,b' Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.\n(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)'
Ross:,"b' Okay! Now, I\x92m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,\nthat\x92s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage\nhim with those.)'"
Chandler:,"b' I don\x92t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth\nwedding. She\x92s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he\nsaves for his yearly trips to (Pause) '"
Rachel:,b' Well what happened at dinner?'
Phoebe:,b' (gasps) My God! What did you order?!'
Rachel:,"b' Wait, but there\x92s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are\ngonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!'"
Chandler:,"b' Honey, it\x92s gonna be okay.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, y\x92know what? It\x92s gonna be okay. I mean you don\x92t\nhave to have this rustic Italian feast. Y\x92know? And-and you don\x92t need, you\ndon\x92t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off\nthe rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love\neach other and that we\x92re gonna get married.'"
Rachel:,b' Do you even understand what off the rack means?!'
Phoebe:,"b' Look, why don\x92t you just pay for it yourself?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, I have some.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, close to\x85 (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to\nwrite it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.) '"
Rachel:,b' Well what?! How-how much is it?!'
Rachel:,b' Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!'
Rachel:,"b' (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, you\x92re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the\nwedding?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, come on, I\x92ve been saving this money for six years and I\nkinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.'"
Phoebe:,"b' (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.\nChandler.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, I realize that honey, but I\x92m not gonna spend all of the\nmoney on one party.'"
Chandler:,"b' Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer\nis no.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yes, I am!'"
Phoebe:,"b' Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.'"
Joey:,b' Hey Rach.'
Rachel:,b' (quietly) Joey.'
Joey:,"b' Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?'"
Rachel:,"b' Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.'"
Joey:,"b' No-no-no, I\x92m serious. You don\x92t smell it? Something\x92s on\nfire.'"
Rachel:,"b' Well no, I don\x92t smell anything.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, y\x92know what? It\x92s probably just your burnin\x92 loins.'"
Ross:,"b' (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?'"
Rachel:,b' Nothing!'
Ross:,"b' (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee\x92s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I\nheat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)'"
Rachel:,"b' Y\x92know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!'"
Ross:,b' So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?'
Rachel:,"b' Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with\nyou. (Exits.)'"
Ross:,"b' (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons\nof porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) \x91Sup?'"
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!'
Ross:,b' (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I\x92m sorry?'
Phoebe:,"b' My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy\nthat worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.'"
Ross:,b' (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!'
Phoebe:,b' He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.'
Ross:,"b' Okay, so it wasn\x92t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him\nacu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a\nmop.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, he\x92s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars\na week!'"
Ross:,"b' Hey, y\x92know what? This is your fault! You\x92re the one that\ndidn\x92t move his-his appointment.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s '"
Ross:,"b' He said he liked that!! Oh you\x92re right, you\x92re right. I\x92m\nsorry.'"
Joey:,"b' Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?'"
Ross:,b' His daughter was hot.'
Joey:,b' Gotcha.'
Chandler:,b' Hey.'
Chandler:,b' Ehh.'
Chandler:,"b' Look, I thought about it too, and I\x92m sorry. I think we should\nspend all of the money on the wedding.'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told\nyou that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes\nyou happy then, then that\x92s what we\x92re gonna do.'"
Chandler:,"b' Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,\ny\x92know? We\x92ll pick our favorite and '"
Chandler:,b' Yeah.'
Chandler:,"b' Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, stuff like where\x92d we live, y\x92know? Like a small place\noutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y\x92know,\nwe could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it\nran through the little kitty door. Of course, we\x92d have an apartment over the garage\nwhere Joey could grow old.'"
Chandler:,b' Sure you do.'
Chandler:,b' You sure?'
Chandler:,b' I love you so much.'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, totally!'"
Joey:,"b' Hello, Zelda.'"
Rachel:,b' Who are you supposed to be?'
Joey:,b' The vicar!'
Rachel:,b' Do you even know what a vicar is?'
Joey:,"b' Like a goalie, right?'"
Rachel:,"b' (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it\x92s enough alright?! You keep\nmaking these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it\x92s\x97I\x92m\nnot\x97it\x92s just not funny anymore!'"
Joey:,"b' All right, I\x92m sorry. Rach I\x97Rach I\x92m sorry. Okay? I\x92m\nsorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)'"
Rachel:,b' All right! Y\x92know what? That\x92s it! You wanna do it?!\nLet\x92s do it!'
Joey:,b' Huh?'
Rachel:,"b' (starting to move closer to him) That\x92s right, I wanna do it with\nyou! I\x92ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.'"
Joey:,b' (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)'
Rachel:,"b' (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I\x92ve been waitin\x92\nso long to get on that body!'"
Joey:,b' This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)'
Rachel:,b' Yeah that\x92s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!'
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey, you\x92re startin\x92 to sound like the butcher\x92s wife\nthere in-in chapter seven.'"
Rachel:,"b' Oh, come on now, don\x92t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,\nI would keep that helmet on because you\x92re in for a '"
Joey:,"b' I don\x92t want to, I\x92m scared.'"
