Ross:,"b' Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one\nstudent wrote, ""I loved Dr. Geller\x92s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller,\nyou are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!""'"
Chandler:,"b' Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there\x92s a big\nselling calendar, eh?'"
Rachel:,b' Who wrote it?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?'"
Ross:,b' Yeah.'
Joey:,"b' Oh, \x91cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the\nsame handwriting and boom, there\x92s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)'"
Chandler:,b' A hot girl\x92s at stake and all of the sudden he\x92s Rain Man.'
Rachel:,"b' Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a\ngirl?'"
Ross:,"b' It\x92s a girl! Anyway, it wou\x97it wouldn\x92t matter. Okay?\nBecause I\x92m a teacher and '"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, is that against the rules?'"
Ross:,"b' No, but it is frowned upon.'"
Chandler:,b' I see.'
Ross:,"b' Besides, there\x92s a big age difference.'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, well think of it like this, when you\x92re 90\x85'"
Ross:,b' I know when I\x92m 90 she\x92ll be like 80 and it won\x92t seem like\nsuch a big difference.'
Joey:,"b' No that\x92s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to\nsay is when you\x92re 90 you\x92ll still have the memory of what it was like to be\nwith a 20-year-old.'"
Joey:,b' Hey Chandler! Y\x92know that girl you went to college with who-who\nbecame a movie director?'
Chandler:,"b' Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.'"
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s a Movement class?'
Joey:,"b' Oh well listen, anyway she\x92s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You\ngotta get me an audition!'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh, I don\x92t know man. I haven\x92t talked to her in like ten\nyears.'"
Joey:,"b' No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you '"
Chandler:,b' You '
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the\ncall or what?'"
Chandler:,"b' Oh okay, I\x92ll-I\x92ll try.'"
Joey:,"b' All right! Thanks! You\x92re the best! Now listen, the last day of\nauditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember\nThursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?'"
Chandler:,"b' Yeah so, Tuesday?'"
Joey:,"b' (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this,\nthe third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What\nday? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!'"
Chandler:,b' (sarcastically) Thank you.'
Joey:,b' Okay.'
Rachel:,b' (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I\x92m gonna check my messages.'
Chandler:,b' You just thought of that in there?'
Rachel:,"b' (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the\ngang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!'"
Rachel:,"b' (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire\ndepartment, there was a fire at our place!'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh my God! How bad was it?'
Rachel:,"b' Well, he didn\x92t say, but it was a fire. I\x92m guessing not very\ngood. Come on, we gotta go!'"
Chandler:,b' What are you smiling about? What is so funny?'
Joey:,"b' The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!'"
Ross:,b' (startled) Yeah?'
Ross:,b' Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a\nthumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)'
Ross:,b' That was you?'
Ross:,"b' Oh I, I don\x92t-I don\x92t think that would be the best idea.'"
Ross:,b' What time?'
Ross:,b' Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)'
Ross:,"b' Oh! So-so seriously, what time?'"
Phoebe:,b' Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a\ncute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through! '
Phoebe:,b' Oh!'
Rachel:,b' My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)'
Joey:,"b' (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this\nThursday?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, how bad is it?'"
Phoebe:,"b' Oh, it\x92s bad. It\x92s really bad. The only thing in there that\nisn\x92t burned is an ass. Which I do '"
Chandler:,b' How\x92s your room Rach?'
Rachel:,b' Everything\x92s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue\nsweater. (Hold it up.)'
Rachel:,b' Fine! I\x92m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)'
Rachel:,"b' (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am '"
Chandler:,b' Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?'
Phoebe:,"b' No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.'"
Phoebe:,b' Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It\x92s me!\nIt\x92s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!'
Rachel:,"b' Okay Phoebe calm down, there\x92s no need to place blame. Okay? (To\nthe fireman) I warned her about those candles.'"
Chandler:,"b' God, it\x92s great to catch up! I can\x92t believe how long\nit\x92s been!'"
Joey:,"b' Chandler, is that\x85 (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler\nnods yes.)'"
Chandler:,b' (on phone) Oh that\x92s great! Good for you.'
Joey:,b' Hey-hey listen\x85 (Chandler waves him away.)'
Chandler:,"b' Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm\x85 (Joey mimes\nthrowing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and\ncutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!'"
Joey:,"b' When you\x92re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?'"
Chandler:,"b' (on phone) Hi! I\x92m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that\nsounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we\x92ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He\nhangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)'"
Joey:,"b' Hey listen, so when\x92s-when\x92s my audition? I mean I know\nit\x92s Thursday, but what time?'"
Chandler:,b' Hi.'
Chandler:,b' (To Joey) We didn\x92t get to the audition. I\x92m gonna take her\nto coffee and then we\x92ll do it then.'
Joey:,b' Ah-ha!'
Chandler:,"b' Honey, it is not a date! I haven\x92t talked to her in ten years!\nYou can\x92t just call up somebody you haven\x92t talked to in ten years and ask them\nfor a favor. There are rules, y\x92know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.'"
Chandler:,"b' No, we only went out once.'"
Chandler:,b' Not once!'
Joey:,"b' Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns\naround to see Chandler glaring at him.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (laughs) Oh that\x92s great, my friend Joey\x92s in the movie\nbusiness.'"
Chandler:,b' (giggles) My friend\x92s name is Joey.'
Chandler:,"b' Yeah, I\x92ve always hated that Howie.'"
Chandler:,b' The nerve huh?'
Chandler:,b' Refill?'
Rachel:,b' Oh my God! It sure didn\x92t look this way when I lived here.'
Phoebe:,"b' Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should\nget to stay here.'"
Rachel:,"b' Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one\x92s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an\naccident.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.'"
Rachel:,b' Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)'
Rachel:,b' I have.'
Joey:,b' This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And\nuh that\x92s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)'
Phoebe:,b' What\x92s that smell?'
Joey:,b' I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)'
Ross:,"b' What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.'"
Ross:,"b' Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone\x92s name, so I-I kinda came\nup with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.'"
Ross:,"b' Umm, no. No.'"
Ross:,"b' Umm, it\x92s Cutie McPretty.'"
Ross:,"b' Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I\x92m having a great time! Y\x92know how\nbefore you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I\nthought it would be too, but it\x92s not. I mean it\x92s not at all.'"
Ross:,b' (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!'
Phoebe:,b' So did you sleep well last night?'
Rachel:,b' I did. '
Phoebe:,b' Yeah?'
Rachel:,"b' I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.'"
Phoebe:,b' Y\x92know what Joey left on my pillow?'
Rachel:,b' What?'
Phoebe:,b' Gum!'
Phoebe:,"b' Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!'"
Phoebe:,b' I don\x92t use a curling iron.'
Rachel:,"b' Well, don\x92t look at me! My hair\x92s straight! Straight!\nStraight! Straight!'"
Rachel:,b' Oh.'
Joey:,b' This is where I keep the pizza. (It\x92s the same location as before.)\nAnd\x97Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it\x92s spot.)'
Phoebe:,b' Thanks Monica!'
Phoebe:,"b' What the smell from Joey\x92s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' I can smell it a little, bake the pie.'"
Phoebe:,b' Okay.'
Phoebe:,b' Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)\nReally?!'
Joey:,"b' (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn\x92t the hair\nstraightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it\nwas the candles. It\x92s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the\nfirst things they teach you in fire school is\x85 (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh\x85\nUhh\x85 Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)'"
Ross:,"b' We had such a great time! She\x92s-she\x92s incredible! I thought\nthe-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn\x92t. It wasn\x92t at all.\nElizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)\n(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!'"
Ross:,"b' Well, not really. I mean technically it\x92s-it\x92s not against the\nrules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last\nnight, Judgey von Holierthanthou.'"
Ross:,b' Yeah. What-what should I do?'
Joey:,"b' Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what\x92s more important? What\npeople think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.'"
Chandler:,b' (entering) Hey.'
Joey:,"b' Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a\nblock of time open say Thursday?'"
Chandler:,b' I couldn\x92t do it.'
Joey:,b' You couldn\x92t do it?!'
Chandler:,"b' Hey, relax I just need more time. We\x92re going to dinner tonight.'"
Ross:,b' Going out with who?'
Chandler:,"b' Uh, Dana Keystone from college.'"
Ross:,b' Oh yeah! Wasn\x92t she uh\x85 (Does the international sign for big\nboobies.)'
Chandler:,"b' No, that was Dana Caplin.'"
Joey:,b' Ah whatever!'
Chandler:,b' Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!'
Chandler:,b' Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should\nstay!'
Chandler:,"b' Oh no-no-no, that\x92s not\x97No-no-no!'"
Chandler:,b' No-no\x97Really?!'
Chandler:,"b' (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh\x85'"
Chandler:,b' Well maybe there is one thing you can do.'
Chandler:,"b' Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I\nhave this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this\numm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on\nThursday?'"
Chandler:,"b' Well, the heart wants what it wants. I\x92ll see you later. (He runs\noff and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)'"
Phoebe:,"b' Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.'"
Phoebe:,b' Oh that\x92s all right. I\x92m still full from your homemade potato\nchips.'
Phoebe:,b' Okay. (Reaches for one.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (gritting her teeth) Okay, I\x92ll be out in a second.'"
Phoebe:,b' That doesn\x92t lock does it?'
Rachel:,"b' Oh, Joey! Sorry!'"
Joey:,b' No that\x92s all right. Don\x92t worry about it.'
Rachel:,b' Oh but look! That\x92s gonna leave a stain! '
Joey:,b' Rach! Hey! It\x92s fine! You\x92re at Joey\x92s!'
Rachel:,b' Really?'
Joey:,b' Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)'
Rachel:,b' I\x92ve never lived like this before.'
Joey:,b' I know.'
Joey:,"b' All right, don\x92t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and\neats it.)'"
Ross:,b' What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?'
Ross:,"b' Oh, you have some studying to do?'"
Ross:,"b' Y\x92know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to\x85\n(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)'"
Ross:,"b' Nothing, I\x92m-I\x92m just, I\x92m so comfortable with you!'"
Ross:,"b' What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?'"
Ross:,"b' What?! No! No! Wait! You\x92re right, this is stupid. Who cares what\npeople think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There\x92s nothing wrong with\nthat. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)\nBurt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.'"
Ross:,"b' That\x92s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we\x92re\ndating. And you may frown upon that, but we\x92re not gonna hide it anymore.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' Really? Its not just frowned upon?'
Rachel:,b' I love it at Joey\x92s!'
Joey:,"b' Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)'"
Chandler:,"b' (entering, sees Rachel\x92s throw) Ni-hi-ice! '"
Rachel:,b' Thanks!'
Chandler:,"b' (To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?'"
Joey:,"b' Oh, very funny. I don\x92t know if you remember, but my audition was\nsupposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn\x92t say anything until Joey figures it out.)\nYou got me the audition?! Let\x92s hug it up! (They hug.)'"
Chandler:,b' Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you\nget the part?'
Phoebe:,b' (entering) Hey! Hi!'
Rachel:,b' Hi!'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!'"
Rachel:,b' Uh-huh.'
Phoebe:,"b' Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started\nthe fire but I think I\x92m partly at fault. You see, I didn\x92t, I didn\x92t tell\nyou but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y\x92know let\x92s just\nface it, that\x92s just kindling! So I think it\x92s better that I stay at\nJoey\x92s.'"
Rachel:,"b' No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y\x92know what?\nI\x92m fine here.'"
Phoebe:,"b' Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.'"
Chandler:,b' Really?'
Phoebe:,b' Yeah she said something about crumbies.'
Chandler:,b' No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)'
Phoebe:,"b' (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me\ncrazy!'"
Joey:,"b' That\x92s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey\x92s.'"
Rachel:,"b' No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don\x92t want to switch! Please come on! I\ncan throw wet paper towels here!'"
Phoebe:,b' No but at Monica\x92s you can eat cookies over the sink!'
Rachel:,b' I know. I\x92m sorry.'
Phoebe:,b' All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet\npaper towels.)'
Joey:,b' Yeah. '
Phoebe:,"b' God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica\x92s.)'"
Ross:,b' Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can\x92t date you or have a hot\nplate in my office. I can\x92t believe we have to stop seeing each other.'
Ross:,"b' I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can\x92t date. It\x92s\nagainst the rules. It\x92s forbidden.'"
Ross:,b' What?'
Ross:,b' Really?'
Ross:,"b' Well I-I-I don\x92t care how hot it is it\x92s-it\x92s uh, it\x92s\nwrong.'"
Ross:,b' (feeling it too) No! No! It\x92s wrong! It\x92s-it\x92s-it\x92s\nnaughty. It\x92s taboo.'
Ross:,b' Let\x92s also get a hot plate!'
Chandler:,b' Hey!'
Joey:,b' Hey!'
Chandler:,b' So?!'
Joey:,b' So?'
Chandler:,b' It\x92s Thursday! How was the audition?!'
Joey:,"b' Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what?\nThurs\x97(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a\nsecond Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)'"
